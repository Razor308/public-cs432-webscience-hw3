Scott Applewhite)</div></div></div></a><div class="Article" data-key="article"><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday called an abrupt end to negotiations with Democrats over additional COVID-19 relief, delaying action until after the election despite ominous warnings from his own Federal Reserve chairman about the deteriorating conditions in the economy.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Trump tweeted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was “not negotiating in good faith” and said he’s asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to direct all his focus before the election into confirming his U.S. Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">“I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business,” Trump tweeted.</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-78"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-40">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-43"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-41"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle1" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Hours later, Trump appeared to edge back a bit from his call to end negotiations. He took to Twitter again and called on Congress to send him a “Stand Alone Bill for Stimulus Checks ($1,200)” — a reference to a pre-election batch of direct payments to most Americans that had been a central piece of negotiations between Pelosi and the White House. Pelosi has generally rejected taking a piecemeal approach to COVID relief.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">“I am ready to sign right now. Are you listening Nancy?” Trump said in a flurry of tweets Tuesday evening. He also called on Congress to immediately approve $25 billion for airlines and $135 billion the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">The unexpected turn could be a blow to Trump’s reelection prospects and comes as his administration and campaign are in turmoil. Trump is quarantining in the White House with a case of COVID, and the latest batch of opinion polls shows him significantly behind former Vice President Joe Biden with the election four weeks away. </p><div class="relatedStory-0-2-84 Component-block-0-2-79"><div class="intro-0-2-85">Impact on the Economy:</div><ul class="list-0-2-86"><li class="relatedStory-0-2-90"><a class="link-0-2-91" href="/article/virus-outbreak-donald-trump-financial-markets-seoul-hong-kong-e3482018c3c8de77076254e631e9d585">– <!-- -->Asian shares mixed after Trump calls off stimulus talks </a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-90"><a class="link-0-2-91" href="/article/virus-outbreak-new-orleans-hurricane-laura-hurricanes-archive-f6bc89b0a2d2b667fbb7a39727e4eb82">– <!-- -->Unemployed in New Orleans find careers in community health</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-90"><a class="link-0-2-91" href="/article/virus-outbreak-business-economy-32223b01e6f8034a1855bd4bbe005b71">– <!-- -->US job postings edge lower, to 6.49 million</a></li></ul></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">The collapse means that Trump and down-ballot Republicans will face reelection without delivering aid to voters — such as the $1,200 direct payments, or “Trump checks,” to most individuals — even as the national jobless rate is about 8% with millions facing the threat of eviction. One endangered Republican, Maine Sen.

While the stock market has clawed much of its way back after cratering in the early weeks of the crisis, unemployment stands at 7.9%, and the nearly 10 million jobs that remain lost since the start of the pandemic exceed the number that the nation shed during the entire 2008-09 Great Recession.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for further explanation of the timing of the president’s decision to halt negotiations.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, pushed back against the notion that breaking off negotiations could hurt the president at the ballot box.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">“Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Congressional Democrats have not been honest brokers,” Murtaugh said. “They would rather have a political issue to help Joe Biden than act to help Americans.

The $1,200 stimulus checks, supplemental $600 unemployment benefits each week, and aid to small businesses boosted household incomes and enabled many low-income Americans to pay bills and rent and maintain their overall spending, according to data from Opportunity Insights.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">But the recovery has slowed and certain sectors such as restaurants, hotels, theaters and airlines remain in bad shape, shedding jobs and risking permanent realignment.

\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I do not believe hopes of a stimulus deal are now gone forever,\" Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a commentary. “One of Mr. Trump’s favorite negotiating tactics, judging by past actions, is to walk away from the negotiating table abruptly. The intention being to frighten the other side into concessions.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>With Chinese markets closed for a weeklong holiday, trading in Asia has been subdued. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.4% to 24,087.46 and the Kospi in South Korea added 0.3% to 2,372.49.

Now, investors face the prospect that more aid may not come until next year, after the new Congress is seated, said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This isn’t just pushing it off until after the election, this realistically is pushing it off until spring,” Delwiche said. \"I don't think this is just a one-day financial markets reaction.

Pelosi has generally rejected taking a piecemeal approach to COVID relief.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Without more stimulus, analysts expect that growth will slow significantly in the final three months of the year. Last month, Goldman Sachs slashed its forecast for growth in the fourth quarter to just 3% at an annual rate, down from a previous forecast of 6%, because they no longer expected an aid package to be approved. That would leave the U.S. economy 2.5% smaller at the end of 2020 than a year earlier, even after a large rebound in the July-September quarter.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The stimulus cutoff coincides with a slowdown in hiring, as employers added 661,000 jobs in September, the government said Friday. That was down from 1.5 million in August and 1.8 million in July.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A report on Tuesday showed that U.S. employers advertised slightly \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-business-economy-32223b01e6f8034a1855bd4bbe005b71\">fewer job openings\u003c/a> in August than the prior month. But the number was nevertheless better than economists expected.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Several big challenges lie ahead of markets. Chief among them is the still-raging pandemic, as so clearly illustrated by Trump’s \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-donald-trump-pandemics-medication-archive-b19734ef456d63f04e84602fd1c488c9\">COVID-19 diagnosis\u003c/a> and brief stay in the hospital. The worry is that a ramp-up in infections could cause governments to bring back some of the restrictions they put on businesses early this year, which sent the economy hurtling into a recession. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The upcoming election adds to uncertainty about tax rates and regulations on businesses, while tensions between the United States and China continue to simmer. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 0.74% from 0.75% late Tuesday. While that’s still very low, the yield has been generally climbing since dropping close to 0.50% in early August. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In other trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 80 cents to $39.87 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
