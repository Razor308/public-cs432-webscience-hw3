(Chip Somodevilla/Pool via AP)</div></div></div></a><div class="Article" data-key="article"><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">WASHINGTON (AP) — FBI Director Chris Wray told lawmakers Thursday that antifa is an ideology, not an organization, delivering testimony that puts him at odds with President Donald Trump, who has said he would designate it a terror group.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Hours after the hearing, Trump took to Twitter to chastise his FBI director for his statements on antifa and on Russian election interference, two themes that dominated a congressional hearing on threats to the American homeland.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Referring to antifa, the president wrote: “And I look at them as a bunch of well funded ANARCHISTS &amp; THUGS who are protected because the Comey/Mueller inspired FBI is simply unable, or unwilling, to find their funding source, and allows them to get away with “murder”. LAW &amp; ORDER!”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">The Twitter barbs thrust Wray again into a spotlight that he has spent three years trying to avoid after his predecessor, James Comey, became entangled in politics before being ultimately fired. Though Wray said as recently as Thursday that the FBI made unacceptable mistakes during its investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, Trump nonetheless has intermittently lashed out at Wray over the pace of fixing those problems and continues to regard his intelligence community with suspicion because of the Russia probe.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Wray did not dispute in his testimony Thursday that antifa activists were a serious concern, saying that antifa was a “real thing” and that the FBI had undertaken “any number of properly predicated investigations into what we would describe as violent anarchist extremists,” including into individuals who identify with antifa.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">But, he said, “It’s not a group or an organization. It’s a movement or an ideology.”</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-78"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-40">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-43"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-41"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle1" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">That characterization contradicts the depiction from Trump, who in June singled out antifa — short for “anti-fascists” and <a class="" href="/6b23fc56ac200d719daa2c4245cc5a88">an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups</a><!-- --> — as responsible for the violence that followed George Floyd’s death. Trump tweeted that the U.S. would be designating antifa as a terrorist organization, even though such designations are historically reserved for foreign groups and antifa lacks the hierarchical structure of formal organizations.</p><div class="relatedStory-0-2-84 Component-block-0-2-79"><div class="intro-0-2-85">More Stories:</div><ul class="list-0-2-86"><li class="relatedStory-0-2-87"><a class="link-0-2-88" href="/article/6b23fc56ac200d719daa2c4245cc5a88">– <!-- -->A look at the antifa movement Trump is blaming for violence</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-87"><a class="link-0-2-88" href="/article/583432c84feb1d26ea919c0e2f0de54a">– <!-- -->False claims of antifa protesters plague small U.S. cities</a></li><li class="relatedStory-0-2-87"><a class="link-0-2-88" href="/article/20b9b86dba5c480bad759a3bd34cd875">– <!-- -->As Trump blames antifa, protest records show scant evidence </a></li></ul></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">The hearing before the House Homeland Security Committee — established after the Sept. 11 attacks to confront the threat of international terrorism — focused almost entirely on domestic matters, including violence by white supremacists as well as anti-government extremists. The topics underscored the shift of attention by law enforcement at a time of intense divisions and polarization inside the country. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">But one area where foreign threats were addressed was in the presidential election and Russia’s attempts to interfere in the campaign.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Wray sought to make clear the scope of the threats the country faces while resisting lawmakers’ attempts to steer him into politically charged statements. When asked whether extremists on the left or the right posed the bigger threat, he pivoted instead to an answer about how solo actors, or so-called “lone wolves,” with easy access to weapons were a primary concern.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">“We don’t really think of threats in terms of left, right, at the FBI. We’re focused on the violence, not the ideology,” he said later.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">The FBI director said racially motivated violent extremists, such as white supremacists, have been responsible for the most lethal attacks in the U.S. in recent years. But this year the most lethal violence has come from anti-government activists, such as anarchists and militia-types, Wray said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Wray also affirmed the intelligence community’s assessment of Russian interference in the November election, which he said was taking the form of foreign influence campaigns aimed at sowing discord and swaying public opinion as well as efforts to denigrate Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">He said that the U.S. had not yet seen targeting of election infrastructure like in 2016, but efforts to sow doubt about the election’s integrity are a serious concern, he said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">“What concerns me the most is the steady drumbeat of misinformation and sort of amplification of smaller cyber intrusions,” Wray said. “I worry that they will contribute over time to a lack of confidence of American voters and citizens in the validity of their vote.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">“I think that would be a perception,” Wray added, “not a reality. I think Americans can and should have confidence in our election system and certainly in our democracy.

LAW &amp; ORDER!”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Twitter barbs thrust Wray again into a spotlight that he has spent three years trying to avoid after his predecessor, James Comey, became entangled in politics before being ultimately fired. Though Wray said as recently as Thursday that the FBI made unacceptable mistakes during its investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, Trump nonetheless has intermittently lashed out at Wray over the pace of fixing those problems and continues to regard his intelligence community with suspicion because of the Russia probe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Wray did not dispute in his testimony Thursday that antifa activists were a serious concern, saying that antifa was a “real thing” and that the FBI had undertaken “any number of properly predicated investigations into what we would describe as violent anarchist extremists,” including into individuals who identify with antifa.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But, he said, “It’s not a group or an organization. It’s a movement or an ideology.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>That characterization contradicts the depiction from Trump, who in June singled out antifa — short for “anti-fascists” and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/6b23fc56ac200d719daa2c4245cc5a88\">an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups\u003c/a> — as responsible for the violence that followed George Floyd's death. Trump tweeted that the U.S. would be designating antifa as a terrorist organization, even though such designations are historically reserved for foreign groups and antifa lacks the hierarchical structure of formal organizations.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"05ea8a90-e010-11ea-9a9b-3951dc326b56\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The hearing before the House Homeland Security Committee — established after the Sept. 11 attacks to confront the threat of international terrorism — focused almost entirely on domestic matters, including violence by white supremacists as well as anti-government extremists. The topics underscored the shift of attention by law enforcement at a time of intense divisions and polarization inside the country. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But one area where foreign threats were addressed was in the presidential election and Russia’s attempts to interfere in the campaign.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Wray sought to make clear the scope of the threats the country faces while resisting lawmakers' attempts to steer him into politically charged statements. When asked whether extremists on the left or the right posed the bigger threat, he pivoted instead to an answer about how solo actors, or so-called “lone wolves,” with easy access to weapons were a primary concern.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\"We don’t really think of threats in terms of left, right, at the FBI. We’re focused on the violence, not the ideology,” he said later.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The FBI director said racially motivated violent extremists, such as white supremacists, have been responsible for the most lethal attacks in the U.S. in recent years. But this year the most lethal violence has come from anti-government activists, such as anarchists and militia-types, Wray said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Wray also affirmed the intelligence community's assessment of Russian interference in the November election, which he said was taking the form of foreign influence campaigns aimed at sowing discord and swaying public opinion as well as efforts to denigrate Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He said that the U.S. had not yet seen targeting of election infrastructure like in 2016, but efforts to sow doubt about the election's integrity are a serious concern, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“What concerns me the most is the steady drumbeat of misinformation and sort of amplification of smaller cyber intrusions,” Wray said. “I worry that they will contribute over time to a lack of confidence of American voters and citizens in the validity of their vote.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think that would be a perception,” Wray added, “not a reality. I think Americans can and should have confidence in our election system and certainly in our democracy. But I worry that people will take on a feeling of futility because of all of the noise and confusion that's generated.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump has resisted the idea of Russian interference aimed at benefiting his campaign and has been eager, along with other administration officials, to talk about intelligence officials' assessment that China prefers that Trump lose to Biden.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He responded on that front Thursday evening, tweeting: “But Chris, you don’t see any activity from China, even though it is a FAR greater threat than Russia, Russia, Russia.

Police officers and protesters have been seriously injured and killed. But federal law enforcement officials have offered little evidence that antifa-aligned protesters could be behind a movement that has appeared nearly simultaneously in hundreds of cities and towns in all 50 states since Floyd's death.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The AP obtained copies of daily confidential “Intelligence Notes” distributed this past week to local enforcement by the Department of Homeland Security that repeat, without citing evidence, that “organized violent opportunists — including suspected anarchist extremists — could increasingly perpetrate nationwide targeting of law enforcement and critical infrastructure.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We lack detailed reporting indicating the level of organization and planning by some violent opportunists and assess that most of the violence to date has been loosely organized on a level seen with previous widespread outbreaks of violence at lawful protests,” the assessment for Monday says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The following day, the assessment noted “several uncorroborated reports of bricks being pre-staged at planned protest venues nationwide.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Although we have been unable to verify the reporting through official channels, the staging of improvised weapons at planned events is a common tactic used by violent opportunists,” the Tuesday assessment says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But social media posts warning that stacks of bricks have been left at protest sites in Atlanta, Boston and Los Angeles have been \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/2217e8c8af5dcdc1d47622822294ce2e\">debunked by local officials\u003c/a> who have explained that the masonry was out in the open before the protests or was for use in construction projects.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nichols, the balloon artist, hardly fits the portrait of a radical. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He recently gained local notice for a giant balloon rabbit and other sculptures \u003ca href=\"https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/video/4511331-minnesota-balloon-artist-adds-easter-theme-to-yard-display/\">displayed in his front yard\u003c/a> for Easter. He laughed when asked if he had any ties to antifa or other militant groups. A white man who lives less than a half mile from where Floyd was killed on May 25, Nichols said he protested to support of his neighbors, many of whom are black.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was the most insane thing I’ve seen in my life,” he said. “The city was going crazy.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nichols said he and a friend helped douse a dumpster fire near a laundromat. He remembers getting a text from his mother saying that Minneapolis had set an 8 p.m. curfew, but he thought it would be enforced loosely.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Had I known that being out after curfew would be such a severe penalty, I would have never done it,” Nichols said, adding that he missed his son's high school graduation while he was in jail.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lars Ortiz, a 35-year-old classical musician, said he was driving just blocks from his Minneapolis home on May 29 after visiting a friend recovering from COVID-19 when officers pulled him out of his car at gunpoint. He said he had been unaware of the 8 p.m. curfew enacted that night.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ortiz and another friend in the car with him were put in zip-tie restraints and forced to wait on a bus for hours before police took them to jail, where he would spend the weekend. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was scary. It was confusing. I felt violated,” said Ortiz, a cellist who identifies as a biracial Mexican American.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ortiz was held on a riot charge and curfew violation. He said he was told when he was released from jail on Monday the more serious rioting charge was dropped. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Lt. Andy Knotz of the Anoka County Sheriff’s Office, whose deputies were deployed from the suburban county north of Minneapolis into the city to help with the unrest, said it was a “chaotic scene” and that Ortiz was coming from the direction of the protests. Knotz said Ortiz was removed from his car by the Minnesota State Patrol, and an Anoka deputy took him to the police station.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\"In chaos like that you can’t determine who is legit and who isn’t,” Knotz said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Natalie Cook, 43, who’s white, said she had never before participated in a protest, but wanted to be there to support and protect her 24-year-old son, who’s black.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Not only did I want to go to be an ally to black people, but I wanted to go to support my son,\" Cook said. “Also, I was afraid to send him out by himself.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Cook said they were marching peacefully with about 100 protesters for hours when police started using tear gas and shooting rubber bullets. As they tried to get away, they were pepper sprayed and her son was hit at close range by a rubber bullet, she said. They were both jailed and released on Monday, charged with riot and violating curfew.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cook said her son was deeply affected by Floyd’s death and she doesn’t have any regrets about going out to make their voices heard. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“My son was really struggling with it,” she said. “We couldn’t just sit by and watch.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP filed public records requests seeking arrest reports and other documents that might show what evidence law enforcement officers have against Nichols, Ortiz the Cooks and others arrested in Minneapolis. Those records have not yet been provided.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Washington, the D.C. Metropolitan Police arrested at least 81 people last weekend, including some as young as 13. Most were charged with curfew violations and felony rioting, which could result in \u003ca href=\"https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/22-1322.html#\">up to 180 days in jail and $5,000 in fines\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Among the highest profile arrests made by federal authorities in the last week was Matthew Lee Rupert. Prosecutors allege the 28-year-old Illinois man traveled to Minneapolis to participate in riots and then posted videos on a Facebook page showing him looting stores and handing out explosives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In one video, Rupert, a convicted felon, says: “We come to riot, boy! This is what we came for!”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Though Rupert is alleged to have targeted police officers, there is no evidence cited in \u003ca href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-mn/pr/federal-criminal-complaint-charges-illinois-man-traveling-minnesota-riot-possession\">his indictment \u003c/a> he is affiliated with any organized group. Among the few indicators of his political beliefs was a series of Facebook posts celebrating Trump's 2017 inauguration. “Trump is my president but I’m not racist,” he wrote, adding that he loves Mexican food.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rupert, who made an initial court appearance Friday, remains in federal custody. A federal public defender assigned to represent him did not respond to a voicemail message seeking comment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Michael German, a former FBI agent and fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, said people often travel and cross state lines to participate in protests and that not all of them have peaceful intent. He said politicians and law enforcement often cite the presence of out-of-towners to justify greater police force against protesters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s an old tactic for law enforcement policing protests to suggest that the problems are being caused by outside agitators,” German said. “It opens up the opportunity for greater police violence in response.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Among those who traveled to Minneapolis to protest Floyd’s killing was Tara Houska, a 36-year-old attorney and member of the Couchiching First Nation from northern Minnesota. An activist for indigenous rights, she was arrested in Minneapolis last Saturday night and charged with not complying with a peace officer.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Houska, who attended college and law school in the city, said she was with a group a couple blocks from where Floyd died when police told them they were breaking curfew. They replied they were going home, she said, and then the officers hit them with pepper spray and zip-tied their hands.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Almost everyone that was in our holding tank with us was from Minnesota,\" Houska said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sierra West, 29, of Kansas City, Missouri, said she drove to Minneapolis with a friend because she is “so angry about what is happening” with police brutality and wanted to peacefully protest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After marching for hours, West broke away from the crowds and was walking back to her car through an alley alone when police arrested her early Saturday on riot and curfew violation charges. She said she did nothing to provoke the four officers who confronted her.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“They were hiding, and they literally jumped out of the shadows with guns drawn on me,” she said. “The street was completely empty.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>West, who is white and describes herself as a strong supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, was freed from jail on Monday afternoon.\u003c/p>\u003cp>University of Minnesota Law School student Santana Boulton, 23, said a police officer pepper-sprayed her in the face on May 28 before she was tear-gassed two days later and then arrested on Sunday, charged with unlawful assembly and violating a curfew.\u003c/p>\u003cp>About 15 minutes before the 8 p.m. curfew, Boulton said she and her boyfriend joined a large crowd of marchers on Interstate 35. People linked arms and kneeled before two lines of police officers formed near the protesters. She said she never heard any orders to disperse.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was nothing like a riot. It was a sit-in,” she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Boulton, a white woman who moved from Michigan to Minneapolis to attend law school, was arrested and spent 16 hours in custody. She described herself as “philosophically an anarchist,” but “not a revolutionary.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Antifa isn’t even real,” Boulton said. “As an actual person who identifies with the political label of anarchist, the only thing anarchists do is have meetings where they argue for five hours and get nothing done.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kunzelman reported from Silver Spring, Maryland, Bleiberg from Dallas and Durkin Richer from West Harwich, Massachusetts.
