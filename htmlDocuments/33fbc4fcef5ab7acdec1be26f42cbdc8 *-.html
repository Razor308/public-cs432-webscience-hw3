Stebnyk in the western part of the country, where Dr. Natalia Stetsik is watching the rising number of patients with alarm and anguish.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s incredibly difficult. We are catastrophically short of doctors,” says Stetsik, the chief doctor at the only hospital in the town of 20,000 people. “It’s very hard for a doctor to even see all the patients.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The hospital is supposed to accommodate 100 patients, but it's already stretched to the limit, treating 106 patients with COVID-19.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Early in the pandemic, Ukraine’s ailing health care system struggled with the outbreak, and authorities introduced a tight lockdown in March to prevent hospitals from getting overwhelmed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The number of cases slowed during the summer but began to rise again quickly, prompting the government at the end of August to close Ukraine's borders for a month. Despite that, the number of positive tests reported in the country continued climbing quickly and reached a new daily peak of 5,397 on Thursday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Overall, COVID-19 infections in Ukraine have nearly doubled in the past month, topping 244,000.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The number of patients is rising, and an increasing share of them are in grave condition,” Stetsik told The Associated Press of the situation in Stebnyk, a quiet town in the Lviv region. “The virus is becoming more aggressive and more difficult to deal with.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>She said many of those doing poorly are in their 30s, adding that an increasing number of them need expensive medication.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There is a similar situation across entire Ukraine,” she said, adding that hospitals have run out of funds to provide drugs, forcing patients in some areas to buy their own.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The World Health Organization warns that the number of infections in Ukraine could continue to grow and reach 7,000-9,000 a day.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The government wants to avoid imposing a new lockdown, but officials acknowledge that the rising number of infections could make it necessary. It has sought to introduce a more flexible approach to minimize the economic damage, dividing the country into various zones, depending on the pace of infections.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At a meeting Monday with officials in Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy chastised them for failing to do enough to slow the spread and taking too long to provide necessary supplies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We spend weeks on doing things that must be done within days,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Zelenskiy specifically urged them to move faster on ensuring that hospitals have enough supplementary oxygen, noting that only about 40% of beds for COVID-19 patients have access to it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ukraine’s corruption-ridden economy has been drained by a six-year conflict with Russia-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country, and Zelenskiy's administration inherited health care reforms from his predecessor that slashed government subsidies, leaving hospital workers underpaid and poorly equipped.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Last month, Zelenskiy ordered the government to increase wages for medical workers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Official statistics show that 132 medical workers have died from the coronavirus, although the figure doesn't include those who tested negative but had symptoms typical for COVID-19.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One of them was Ivan Venzhynovych, a 51-year-old therapist from the western town of Pochaiv, who described the challenges of dealing with the outbreak in an interview with the AP in May.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Venzhynovych died last week of double pneumonia, which his colleagues believed was caused by the coronavirus, even though he tested negative for it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He certainly had COVID-19,” said Venzhynovych's widow, Iryna, a doctor at the hospital where he worked. “There are many infections among medical workers, some of them confirmed and others not.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The government pays the equivalent to $56,000 to families of medical workers who die from the coronavirus. But Venzhynovych's widow can't receive the payment because he tested negative.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As the number of infections soars, many lawmakers and top officials are testing positive, including former President Petro Poroshenko, who was hospitalized in serious condition with virus-induced pneumonia.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Medical professionals want the government to bring back a sweeping lockdown, pointing to the scarce resources for the health care system.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s possible that Ukraine would need to return to a tight quarantine like in the spring.
