<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7039362-Senate-Intelligence-Committee-Russia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">The nearly 1,000-page report</a><!-- -->, the fifth and final one from the Republican-led Senate intelligence committee on the Russia investigation, details how Russia launched an aggressive effort to interfere in the election on Trump’s behalf. It says the Trump campaign chairman had regular contact with a Russian intelligence officer and that other Trump associates were eager to exploit the Kremlin’s aid, particularly by maximizing the impact of the disclosure of Democratic emails hacked by Russian intelligence officers.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">The report is the culmination of a bipartisan probe that produced what the committee called “the most comprehensive description to date of Russia’s activities and the threat they posed.” The investigation spanned more than three years as the panel’s leaders said they wanted to thoroughly document the unprecedented attack on U.S. elections. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">The findings, including unflinching characterizations of furtive interactions between Trump associates and Russian operatives, echo to a large degree those of <a class="" href="/48f9d5132d7a4e2d823edad8fc407979">special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation</a><!-- --> and appear to repudiate the Republican president’s claims that the FBI had no basis to investigate whether his campaign was conspiring with Russia. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Trump, who has repeatedly called the Russia investigations a “hoax,” said Tuesday he “didn’t know anything about” the report, or Russia or Ukraine. He said he had “nothing” to do with Russia.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">While Mueller’s was a criminal probe, the Senate investigation was a counterintelligence effort with the aim of ensuring that such interference wouldn’t happen again.

Trump was largely thwarted by those around him who refused to go along.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mueller laid out multiple episodes in which Trump directed others to influence or curtail the Russia investigation after the special counsel's appointment in May 2017. Those efforts \"were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,\" Mueller wrote.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>After nearly two years, the two-volume, 448-page redacted report made for riveting reading.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In one particularly dramatic moment, Mueller reported that Trump was so agitated at the special counsel's appointment on May 17, 2017, that he slumped back in his chair and declared: \"Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I'm f---ed.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>With that, Trump set out to save himself.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In June of that year, Mueller wrote, \u003ca href=\"https://www.apnews.com/e0d125d737be4a21a81bec3d9f1dffd8\">Trump directed White House Counsel\u003c/a> Don McGahn to call Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversaw the probe, and say that Mueller must be ousted because he had conflicts of interest. McGahn refused — deciding he would sooner resign than trigger a potential crisis akin to the Saturday Night Massacre of firings during the Watergate era.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"afs:Medium:4472910012\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Two days later, the president made another attempt to alter the course of the investigation, meeting with former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and dictating a message for him to relay to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The message: Sessions would publicly call the investigation \"very unfair\" to the president, declare Trump did nothing wrong and say Mueller should limit his probe to \"investigating election meddling for future elections.\" The message was never delivered.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The report's bottom line largely tracked the findings revealed in Attorney General William Barr's four-page memo released a month ago — no collusion with Russia but no clear verdict on obstruction — but it \u003ca href=\"https://www.apnews.com/3ca2f285b54d4312960ed2ddcf6e71e6\">added new layers of detail\u003c/a> about Trump's efforts to thwart the investigation. Looking ahead, both sides were already using the findings to amplify well-rehearsed arguments about Trump's conduct, Republicans casting him as a victim of harassment and Democrats depicting the president as stepping far over the line to derail the investigation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Justice Department released its redacted version of the report about 90 minutes after Barr offered his own final assessment of the findings at a testy news conference. The nation, Congress and Trump's White House consumed it voraciously — online, via a compact disc delivered to legislators and in loose-leaf binders distributed to reporters.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"media:2cb58268fcc640a58f03fad968651e7d\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The release represented a moment of closure nearly two years in the making but also the starting bell for a new round of partisan warfare.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A defiant Trump pronounced it \"a good day\" and tweeted \"Game Over\" in a typeface mimicking the \"Game of Thrones\" logo. By late afternoon, he was airborne for his Mar-a-Lago private club in Florida with wife Melania for the holiday weekend.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Top Republicans in Congress saw vindication, too.\u003c/p>\u003cp>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said it was time to move on from Democrats' effort to \"vilify a political opponent.\" The California lawmaker said the report failed to deliver the \"imaginary evidence\" incriminating Trump that Democrats had sought.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said Republicans should turn the tables and \"investigate the liars who instigated this sham investigation.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Democrats cried foul over Barr's preemptive press conference and said the report revealed troubling details about Trump's conduct in the White House.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wrote that \"one thing is clear: Attorney General Barr presented a conclusion that the president did not obstruct justice while Mueller's report appears to undercut that finding.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler added that the report \"outlines disturbing evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction of justice and other misconduct.\" He sent a letter to the Justice Department requesting that Mueller himself testify before his panel \"no later than May 23\" and said he'd be issuing a subpoena for the full special counsel report and the underlying materials.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Signaling battles ahead, Nadler earlier called the investigation \"incredibly thorough\" work that would preserve evidence for future probes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Barr said he wouldn't object to Mueller testifying.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump himself was never questioned in person, but the report's appendix includes 12 pages of his written responses to queries from Mueller's team.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mueller deemed Trump's written answers — rife with iterations of \"I don't recall\" — to be \"inadequate.\" He considered issuing a subpoena to force the president to appear in person but decided against it after weighing the likelihood of a long legal battle.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In his written answers, Trump said his comment during a 2016 political rally asking Russian hackers to help find emails scrubbed from Hillary Clinton's private server was made \"in jest and sarcastically\" and said he did not recall being told during the campaign of any Russian effort to infiltrate or hack computer systems.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Mueller said that within five hours of Trump's comment, Russian military intelligence officers were targeting email accounts connected to Clinton's office.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mueller evaluated nearly a dozen episodes for possible obstruction of justice, and said he could not conclusively determine that Trump had committed criminal obstruction. The episodes included Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey, the president's directive to subordinates to have Mueller fired and efforts to encourage witnesses not to cooperate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sessions was so affected by Trump's frequent criticism of him for recusing himself from the investigation that he kept a resignation letter \"with him in his pocket every time he went to the White House,\" Mueller said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president's lawyers have said Trump's conduct fell within his constitutional powers, but Mueller's team deemed the episodes deserving of scrutiny for potential criminal acts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As for the question of whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign, Mueller wrote that the campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Mueller said investigators concluded, \"While the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Workers at a Russian troll farm contacted Trump's campaign, claiming to be political activists for conservative grassroots organizations, and asked for signs and other campaign materials to use at rallies. While volunteers provided some of those materials — and set aside a number of signs — investigators don't believe any Trump campaign officials knew the requests were coming from foreign nationals, Mueller wrote.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mueller wrote that investigators \"did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, stressed that Mueller didn't think the president's obligations to run the executive branch entitled him to absolute immunity from prosecution. But to find that the president obstructed justice, he said, Mueller would have needed much clearer evidence that the president acted solely with \"corrupt intent.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>\"The evidence was sort of muddled,\" Blackman said, adding that the president's actions had multiple motivations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The report laid out some of Mueller's reasoning for drawing no conclusion on the question of obstruction.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mueller wrote that he would have exonerated Trump if he could, but he wasn't able to do that given the evidence he uncovered. And he said the Justice Department's standing opinion that a sitting president couldn't be indicted meant he also couldn't recommend Trump be criminally charged, even in secret.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump's written responses addressed no questions about obstruction of justice, as was part of an agreement with Trump's legal team.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He told Mueller he had \"no recollection\" of learning in advance about the much-scrutinized Trump Tower meeting between campaign officials and a Russian lawyer. He also said he had no recollection of knowledge about emails setting up the meeting that promised dirt on Clinton's Democratic campaign.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He broadly denied knowing of any foreign government trying to help his campaign, including the Russian government. He said he was aware of some reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin had made \"complimentary statements\" about him.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It wasn't just Trump under the microscope. But Mueller wrote that he believed prosecutors would be unlikely to meet the burden of proof to show that Donald Trump Jr. and other participants in the Trump Tower meeting \"had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful.\" Nor did Mueller's probe develop evidence that they knew that foreign contributions to campaigns were illegal or other particulars of federal law.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Barr's contention that the report contained only \"limited redactions\" applied more to the obstruction of justice section than its look at Russian election meddling. Overall, about 40 percent of the pages contained at least something that was blocked out, mostly to protect ongoing investigations. Barr had said that he would redact grand jury information and material related to investigations, privacy and intelligence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP writers Zeke Miller, Mary Clare Jalonick, Lisa Mascaro, Dustin Weaver, Deb Riechmann, Susannah George, Michael R.

His political campaign issued its own statement saying “abuses of power” in the Russia investigation “represent the greatest political crime in American history” and everyone involved should be held accountable. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Yet the five-page charging document is limited in scope and does not allege criminal wrongdoing by anyone other than Clinesmith, nor does it offer evidence to support Trump's assertions that the Russia probe was tainted by widespread political bias in the FBI. It makes clear that the FBI relied on Clinesmith's own misrepresentations as it sought to renew its surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"1c2d3790-b900-11ea-e12b-679a3aadbae3\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Durham probe, which is also examining the intelligence community's assessment about Russian election interference, has caused concern among Democrats, who view it as a politically charged exercise meant to relitigate an already closed investigation. They fear that charges or public reports issued so close to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/Election2020\">the 2020 election\u003c/a> could be timed to affect November's vote.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Durham's inquiry has proceeded alongside a parallel effort by Senate Republicans to discredit the Russia probe and as \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/ec6ff91eb756285b63d3c1dcdddf0371\">Attorney General William Barr\u003c/a> has escalated his own \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/57304f689050c5c75aded464656f8455\">criticism of the FBI's probe\u003c/a>.

It remains unclear what additional charges, if any, Durham might bring, though he has been closely scrutinizing how intelligence agencies arrived at the conclusion that Russia had interfered in 2016 to benefit Trump. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Justice Department policy directs prosecutors to not take investigative actions aimed at affecting an election, or that could advantage or disadvantage a candidate. But Barr has said he does not feel constrained by that policy in part because the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, is not a target of Durham's investigation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Durham's work parallels in some respects a separate investigation into the Russia probe by the Justice Department's inspector general office. That office concluded in a report last December that the Russia investigation was opened for a valid reason, but it also identified significant errors and omissions in surveillance applications filed in 2016 and 2017 that targeted Page.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The watchdog office also referred Clinesmith for potential prosecution. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Specifically, the inspector general accused Clinesmith, though not by name, of altering an email to say that Page was “not a source” for another government agency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Page has stated publicly that he was a CIA source. The inspector general's report and Friday's charging document describe how Clinesmith inquired of another government agency, presumably the CIA, whether Page had been a source. He said that that was a fact that would need to be disclosed as the FBI applied to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to renew its surveillance of Page.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In June 2017, the documents show, Clinesmith was provided with information about Page's relationship with the agency, which had approved him as an “operational contact” between 2008 and 2013.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:9228244065\">Full Coverage: Politics\u003c/div>\u003cp>When an FBI colleague who was involved in preparing the surveillance application followed up by instant message with Clinesmith on the question of whether Page had ever been a government source, Clinesmith responded that Page had “never been a source,” according to court documents. \u003c/p>\u003cp>When asked if he had that information in writing, the documents allege, Clinesmith altered an email he had received from the other agency by adding the words “and not a source” and then forwarded it to the FBI supervisory special agent.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The FBI relied on those misrepresentations in its final surveillance application and omitted that information about Page, prosecutors allege, even though any relationship between Page and the government would have been important to disclose to the FISA court to the extent it could help explain interactions Page had had with Russians.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinesmith told the inspector general that he had not actually understood Page to be a source, or “recruited asset,” for another government agency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Kevin deeply regrets having altered the email,\" Shur said in a statement. “It was never his intent to mislead the court or his colleagues, as he believed the information he relayed was accurate, but Kevin understands what he did was wrong and accepts responsibility.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Durham is a veteran prosecutor with a history of special assignments from Washington, including leading a Justice Department investigation into the CIA's harsh interrogation techniques of terror suspects and the destruction of videotapes documenting those interrogations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Barr appointed Durham just weeks after \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/48f9d5132d7a4e2d823edad8fc407979\">special counsel Robert Mueller\u003c/a> concluded his nearly two-year investigation. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Mueller found significant contacts during the 2016 campaign between Russians and Trump associates but did not allege a criminal conspiracy between them.
