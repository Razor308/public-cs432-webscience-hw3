<h> Chris Christie released from hospital following COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment with remdesivir
<p> Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) has been released from a New Jersey hospital after testing positive for COVID-19 diagnosis of last week.
<p> Christie was admitted to the hospital last week, just hours after releasing the news of his diagnosis.
<p> Christie, who is 58 years old, is overweight and has asthma, putting him at more serious risk than those without contributing factors who end up infected with the virus.
<h> What are the details?
<p> On Saturday morning, the former New Jersey governor shared the news on Twitter, writing, &quot;I am happy to let you know that this morning I was released from Morristown Medical Center. I want to thank the extraordinary doctors &amp; nurses who cared for me the last week. Thanks to my family &amp; friends for their prayers. I will have more to say about all of this next week.&quot;

<p> This is Christie&#x27;s first tweet following the announcement that he&#x27;d be checking into the hospital for treatment following news of the positive coronavirus diagnosis.
<p> Last Saturday, he wrote, &quot;In consultation with my doctors, I checked myself into Morristown Medical Center this afternoon. While I am feeling good and only have mild symptoms, due to my history of asthma we decided this is an important precautionary measure.&quot;

<p> According to CNN, doctors prescribed the anti-viral drug remdesivir to assist in Christie&#x27;s treatment.
<p> Christie&#x27;s positive diagnosis announcement came a day after that of President Donald Trump, who last week announced that he and his wife, Melania Trump, tested positive for the virus.
<p> Trump spent the entirety of last weekend at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for treatment. He was released on Monday.
<p> Last week, the New Jersey Republican told ABC News that he had spent some time &quot;off and on&quot; at the White House and with Trump himself in order to help prep for the president&#x27;s debate against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
<p> Christie isn&#x27;t the only Trump cohort who has tested positive for the virus after the president&#x27;s positive diagnosis: White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany tested positive for COVID-19 last week, as did Trump aides Kellyanne Conway, Hope Hicks, Stephen Miller, and more.
