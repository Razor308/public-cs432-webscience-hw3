<p> On Friday, Cuban took to Twitter to share an update on the former Cleveland Cavaliers guard, sharing a picture of a happy-looking West riding a horse at the facility.
<p> &quot;Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, I present to you, Delonte West,&quot; Cuban wrote. &quot;A long, long, long way to go, but he has taken the first steps and shared these with all of us as a thank you for the love and support.&quot;

<p> Last month, public concern for West -- who has a history of mental health issues -- was reignited after a picture showed him appearing to be homeless in Dallas. Among those who attempted to reach him was current Philadelphia 76ers head coach Doc Rivers, who coached West during his time with the Boston Celtics, as well as Cuban, who seems to have given the eight-year NBA guard the assist he needed.
