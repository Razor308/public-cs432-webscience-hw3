<p> Josh Brolin revealed that he enjoyed playing Thanos in &quot;Avengers&quot; a lot more than he enjoyed playing Cable in &quot;Deadpool 2.&quot;
<p> While chatting on the &quot;Team Deakins&quot; podcast, the actor said he got more out of the &quot;Avengers&quot; villain because he would ground him with comparisons to characters in movies like &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and &quot;Scarface.&quot;
<p> Brolin said playing Cable in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; felt like a &quot;business transaction.&quot;
<p> &quot;It was more, &#x27;We need to make this like this,&#x27; whereas I didn&#x27;t feel that way with &#x27;Avengers,&#x27;&quot; Brolin said.
<p> In a recent episode of the &quot;Team Deakins&quot; podcast, in which legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins and his wife James interview past collaborators and Hollywood friends, Josh Brolin (Deakins shot movies Brolin starred in like &quot;No Country For Old Men&quot; and &quot;Sicario&quot;) opened up about playing the evil Titan Thanos in the &quot;Avengers&quot; franchise and time-traveling warrior Cable in &quot;Deadpool 2.&quot;
<p> He revealed that playing the villain in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; was &quot;hard&quot; because he felt the Cable character was a &quot;business transaction&quot; to pull off.
<p> Brolin said he felt there was a lot more freedom to shape Thanos.
<p> The actor recalls the conversations he had with directors Joe and Anthony Russo before making &quot;Avengers: Infinity,&quot; in which Thanos would finally be given a meaty storyline after small cameos in a few earlier Marvel movies.
<p> &quot;I mentioned [Marlon] Brando in &#x27;Apocalypse Now,&#x27; this guy who is very elusive and insane but what he is saying makes sense and is poetical,&quot; Brolin said, referencing Brando&#x27;s iconic role as Colonel Kurtz in director Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s masterpiece.
<p> &quot;I started seeing the parallel, which I liked for me. I loved being able to resort to a film like &#x27;Apocalypse Now&#x27; when I was doing something like &#x27;Avengers.&#x27;&quot;
<p> Brolin said outside of a few instances when he was on set and worked across an actor like Zoe Saldana (who plays Thanos&#x27; daughter Gamora in the Marvel movies), he was playing the CGI-built Thanos by himself in a motion capture suit, or one of the Russos would act across from him.
<p> &quot;I never met Benedict Cumberbatch, we have a whole scene together, I never met him,&quot; Brolin said.
<p> But because of that isolation he was able to tap into an acting he never thought he had.
<p> &quot;The level of conviction needed, which is what I loved about that process, if I can have focus during this process I can do anything,&quot; Brolin said. &quot;It was actually great.&quot;
<p> But Brolin&#x27;s tone completely changed on the podcast when he talked about &quot;Deadpool 2.&quot;
<p> Josh Brolin as Cable in &quot;Deadpool 2.&quot;
Fox
<p> &quot;&#x27;Deadpool&#x27; was hard,&quot; he said. &quot;Even though it was funny, it was harder. That was more of a business transaction, it was more, &#x27;We need to make this like this,&#x27; whereas I didn&#x27;t feel that way with &#x27;Avengers.&#x27;&quot;
<p> Brolin felt the Russos were great at keeping his Thanos performance grounded.
<p> &quot;They would constantly go back and reference &#x27;Scarface&#x27; or &#x27;Dog Day Afternoon.&#x27; Whether or not it was a manipulation, they knew what to throw out there to bring it back into something inspired.&quot;
<p> Whether we&#x27;ll see Brolin as Cable again is unknown. Since Disney bought Fox, the studio responsible for &quot;Deadpool,&quot; there hasn&#x27;t been any word if the family-friendly Disney will take on the R-rated comic legend that Ryan Reynolds has turned into a big-screen moneymaker.
