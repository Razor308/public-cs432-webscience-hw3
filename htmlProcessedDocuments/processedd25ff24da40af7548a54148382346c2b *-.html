<h> Sony Will Reportedly Launch a New PlayStation Store Next Month
<h> It seems PlayStation Store is set to receive a big overhaul ahead of PS5&#x27;s launch in November.
<p> PS5 will be officially launched in over a month and Sony hasn’t revealed the new look of the console’s user interface so far. That said, some new reports suggest that the company will unveil a new version of the PlayStation Store for PS5 next month.
<p> According to PushSquare, Sony has notified developers about an upcoming overhaul in PlayStation Store which is said to include only PS5 and PS4 games. That means the brand new Store will no longer allow you to buy digital games for PS3, PSP, and PS Vita from anywhere other than the consoles’ Store. As the report suggests, the new PlayStation Store will be available through smartphones and the web, in addition to consoles. If the report turns out to be true, the PS4 apps, themes, and avatars will no longer be available through mobile and web.
<p> Sony’s user interface in PlayStation consoles has always known for its simplicity and easy navigation. The new PlayStation Store will probably follow the same policy, however, now that we are going to get an SSD-equipped console, some new tweaks and improvements would definitely help for bringing a super-smooth user experience.
<p> Sony recently shared a new video from PS5, providing a deep look inside the company’s new beast. It’s expected to see more details from the console, including its new user interface, in the coming weeks.
<p> On November 12th, Sony will officially begin a new generation of gaming with PS5. The company has managed to prepare a bunch of interesting launch titles for PS5, including Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Demon’s Souls Remake, Sackbot: A Big Adventure, Destruction: All-Stars, and Godfall.
<p> This is going to be the first time ever that Sony starts a new generation of gaming with two types of a single console: PS5 Standard Edition for $499 and PS5 Digital Edition for $399.
