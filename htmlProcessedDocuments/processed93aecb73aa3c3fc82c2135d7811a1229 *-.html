<p> &quot;We reject their support and the Taliban should know that the President will always protect American interests by any means necessary, unlike Joe Biden who opposed taking out Osama bin Laden and Qassem Soleimani,&quot; Murtaugh said in a statement to Insider.
<p> The statements from the terrorist organization comes as Trump announced on Wednesday that he wanted to completely pull all US troops from Afghanistan by the holiday season.
<p> &quot;We should have the small remaining number of our BRAVE Men and Women serving in Afghanistan home by Christmas,&quot; Trump tweeted.
<p> It is unclear exactly how many US forces remain in the country; however, US Central Command, the military command responsible for the region, previously said it expected around 4,500 troops in Afghanistan by November.
<p> Following Trump&#x27;s tweet, Mujahid described the move as &quot;a very positive step,&quot; according to The Washington Post.
<p> US military officials were caught off-guard by Trump&#x27;s Twitter announcement, which has been a prevailing sentiment throughout his presidency. Republican lawmakers and former military leaders have also expressed frustration at the timeframe of the withdrawal, leading many to speculate that the terrorist group would surge once the US withdraws.
<p> Meanwhile, peace talks between the Afghan government and Taliban remain ongoing. In February, the US signed a peace deal that included steps for it to withdraw all forces from the country in exchange for security assurances. But the efficacy of the peace agreement has been called into question, due to continued violence against Afghan forces by the Taliban.
