<p> A week on and we&#x27;ve now got a look at each of these amiibo in their official packaging. If you like to keep your amiibo boxed for display purposes, you&#x27;ll no doubt be interested in seeing what each one looks like.
<p> So without further ado, here they are:
<p> Each one of these Smash Bros. amiibo will be arriving in 2021, but there&#x27;s no word on the exact release date just yet. In saying this, earlier in the week, Nintendo of America tweeted (and then deleted) the amiibo would be arriving in &quot;Fall&quot; 2021.
<p> Will you be adding any of these amiibo to your collection when they arrive next year? Are you one of those collectors who keep their amiibo in the original packaging? Tell us down below.
<p> When heâ€™s not paying off a loan to Tom Nook, Liam likes to report on the latest Nintendo news and admire his library of video games. His favourite Nintendo character used to be a guitar-playing dog, but nowadays he prefers to hang out with Judd the cat.
<p> @alecseusIn the official art it glows. In FE Three Houses it has a flaming aura.
<p> Anyway, Byleth is really the only one I&#x27;m interested in. Three Houses is my favorite RPG ever. Can&#x27;t wait to get it!
<p> Also the people complaining about the lack of the female alt should understand that no other alts were made for Ultimate DLC (no School Joker and no other Heroes aside from 11) and that we&#x27;re in the middle of a pandemic. It&#x27;s a miracle that we&#x27;re still getting Amiibos at all at this point. it&#x27;s just a plastic video game figure, after all.

Does Marth wear a black coat that he uses as a cape because he doesn&#x27;t put his arms through the sleeves? Is Marth&#x27;s sword flaming and segmented along the blade? Does Marth even hold his sword like that on his Amiibo figure? You might need your eyes checked, buddy...
<p> @Dang69
Same here, but by that logic, female Byleth is just Lucina doing some dress up. Male Byleth doesn&#x27;t even have the same hairstyle or facial structure as Marth. That joke isn&#x27;t even funny anymore in an ironic sense.
<p> By that logic, they&#x27;re both &quot;boring&quot; choices since they&#x27;re the exact same character with no real differences in game. If you like the game that much, you&#x27;d get it regardless, because of how much you like the game itself. That shows you really didn&#x27;t want it to begin with. I wish we could&#x27;ve had both genders and I would&#x27;ve gotten both, but I&#x27;m still getting Byleth&#x27;s Amiibo.
<p> Just buy it or don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just a plastic figure that you probably won&#x27;t get much use out of anyways. XD
<p> The Banjo Kazooie one looks quite good, though I think I would want a Banjo Kazooie plushie, (which are available) over another amiibo figurine! Nintendo&#x27;s attention to detail on these figurines has been pretty incredible though.
