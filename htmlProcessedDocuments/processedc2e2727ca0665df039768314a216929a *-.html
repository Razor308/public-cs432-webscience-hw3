<p> NEW YORK — Rudy Giuliani will apparently never get off the hydroxychloroquine train.
<p> The ex-New York mayor told the New York Daily News on Wednesday that he’s taking the anti-malarial drug as a preventative measure against COVID-19 — even though U.S. regulators advise against it over concerns that the medication can cause serious side effects.
<p> Giuliani, 76, stressed that he has tested negative for the virus several times in the past few days, but said his doctor recommended the hydroxychloroquine regimen since he spent considerable time last week with President Donald Trump and others who have since tested positive.
<p> “All negative so far and no symptoms but I am taking hydroxychloroquine and zinc as a prophylactic,” said Giuliani, who’s these days best known as Trump’s combative personal lawyer. “A study in Italy showed exceptional results.”
<p> Despite Giuliani’s claim that he’s not experiencing symptoms, a source familiar with the matter told The News that the ex-mayor was openly coughing while having dinner Tuesday night at Amata’s in Midtown.
<p> “He really should be in quarantine,” the source said.
<p> Giuliani did not outright deny the source’s observation.
<p> “I am negative and I don’t think I coughed and I was 20 feet away from anyone and wore my mask when the waiter served me,” he said.
<p> The Food and Drug Administration issued guidance in July advising doctors against prescribing hydroxychloroquine to any COVID-19 patients because the drug had not proved effective in treating or preventing the virus.
<p> The FDA also said the drug could cause “abnormal heart rhythms,” especially in patients with preexisting heart or kidney conditions.
