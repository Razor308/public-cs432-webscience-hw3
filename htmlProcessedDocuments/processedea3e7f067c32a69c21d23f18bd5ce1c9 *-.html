<p> Indie publisher Digerati will release The Magister, a new card-battler murder mystery RPG, on Nintendo Switch early next year.
<p> The game&#x27;s being developed by Nerdook (Monster Slayers, Reverse Crawl, Vertical Drop Heroes) and has players building and customising their card decks to fight in battles. You&#x27;ll need to gather clues and discover motives along the way as you investigate a murder and attempt to unmask the culprit.
<p> Here&#x27;s a list of key features and a selection of screenshots
<p> Players take the role of a Magister – agents assigned to enforce the rule of law in the far-flung provinces of the Empire. Dispatched to the remote village of Silverhurst, you must investigate the grim demise of a fellow Magister. You have 14 days to solve the case.
<p> Key features-Randomly generated murder-mystery: A walkthrough won’t help here! The events, clues, motives, and murderer change with every playthrough. Only YOU can identify the guilty suspect.
- Tactical card-based encounters: Your combat and negotiation skills are determined by the cards in your deck. Use a vast array of cards, such as ‘Heartstopper’, ‘Poison Slash’, ‘Weak Joke’, and ‘Long Talk’.
- Pacify enemies for a peaceful outcome: Use ‘Tactical Diplomacy’ as an alternative to fighting and calm foes with your conversation cards to reduce their Rage level to 0.
- Choose your Magister: Different Magisters come with their own specialities and flaws. From cunning alcoholic to intelligent insomniac – every variation defines a different adventure.
- Recruit a human ally or furry companion: If needed, a Mercenary, Spy, or Sage can be recruited to assist in your investigation. You can also befriend one of the local cats or dogs to fight by your side in battles.
- Set in a captivating fantasy world: You have 14 days to wander Silverhurst and befriend or intimidate its inhabitants as you race against time to unmask the murderer.
<p> If you&#x27;re liking the sound of this one, keep an eye out for it launching on the eShop early 2021. Nerdook&#x27;s previous game, deck-building RPG Monster Slayers, has a very respectable Metacritic rating of 86 on PC so this could well be another winner.

<p> Ryan can list the first 151 Pokémon all in order off by heart – a feat he calls his ‘party trick’ despite being such an introvert that he’d never be found anywhere near a party. He’d much rather just have a night in with Mario Kart and a pizza, and we can’t say we blame him.
