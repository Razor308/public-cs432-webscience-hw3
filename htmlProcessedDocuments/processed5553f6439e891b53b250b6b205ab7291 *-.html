<h> Genshin Impact Version 1.1 improvements:
<p> We’ll be able to lock Artifacts and weapons, so they can’t be accidentally used as level-up fodder.
<p> An encyclopedia will be added so you can check the description of items. Alongside how to obtain them.
<p> An Anemoculus Detector and a Geoculus Detector will be added. Anemoculus and Geoculus are Oculi, small collectibles used for stamina upgrades. This will make it easier for players to find them.
<h> That’s it for the upgrades coming in Version 1.1 on November 11. However, miHoYo also revealed more changes will be coming soon:
<p> A shortcut function to eat food items during battle will be added. That way you won’t have to go through the menu each time.
<p> When strengthening weapons to their current max level, we’ll get the excess Experience back in form of ores.
<p> A new in-game report function will be added. The translation doesn’t detail what it is for but I assume bug reporting.
<p> Characters will stay playable even if you send them on an Expedition. As you already know, Fischl has a 25% Expedition time reduction bonus in Mondstadt. This is very important as you’ll be able to use Fischl even when she’s on an Expedition. We won’t have to choose between playing with her or sending her away.
<p> Lastly, a co-op event will be held soon. It’s likely it will be the same Ignite the Elemental Crucible co-op event from the Closed Beta 3, but with changes and improvements.
<p> Genshin Impact will receive its Version 1.1 update on November 11. That’s one month from now on. As we wait for the update, don’t forgot to play the game the way you want and having fun. Meanwhile, you can also watch Lisa’s seiyuu Rie Tanaka playing the game. The game also nearly reached 20 millions downloads on mobile alone.
