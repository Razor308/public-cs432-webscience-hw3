<p> Nintendo has revealed that its Super Nintendo World theme park at Universal Studios Japan will now open in spring 2021 following delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
<p> Universal initially postponed the park&#x27;s opening this summer; it was originally going to have its grand opening fall in line with Tokyo&#x27;s 2020 Summer Olympics, which was also delayed. Now, though, things appear to be back on track – so long as the pandemic is more under control next year, that is.
<p> Softening the blow of the delay, Nintendo has also revealed that a new &#x27;Mario Café and Store&#x27; will be opening its doors next week on 16th October. Also located at Universal Studios Japan (but in the Hollywood area), the Mario Café and Store offers Mario and Luigi-themed food and drink, official products to spend your money on, and is even decorated with lots of Nintendo goodness.
<p> Ryan can list the first 151 Pokémon all in order off by heart – a feat he calls his ‘party trick’ despite being such an introvert that he’d never be found anywhere near a party. He’d much rather just have a night in with Mario Kart and a pizza, and we can’t say we blame him.
<p> @Kimyonaakuma I mean, I can kinda see why considering the big band music in 3D World and general &quot;actors&quot; aesthetic of the Mario franchise, but... even then, I just can&#x27;t wrap my head around this in particular. I guess since you rarely see buildings in Mario games that aren&#x27;t Toad-shaped?
<p> @Noid@Kimyonaakuma My understanding from the article is that these are repurposed buildings in the park as a way to offer something Mario in lieu of the actual park area. The stores in the Mario World area will be much more heavily themed, I presume.
<p> Interesting that the shop shares design elements from SMO&#x27;s Princess Peach&#x27;s castle. Considering that the main area was designed pre-2017, whatever&#x27;s in the castle in SNW will take more inspiration from the NSMB or MK7 iterations of the interior unless if it got a last minute redesign after Mario Odyssey came out.
<p> That’s great! I’m glad it is back on track to open by the Tokyo Olympics. And I’m very glad Japan seems to be doing better during this pandemic right now! My country (America) is not doing well at all, so it’s reassuring to see other countries doing okay
