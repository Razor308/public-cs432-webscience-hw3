<p> WASHINGTON, D.C.â€”The Commission on Presidential Debates has invited a widely revered and respected centrist named Nancy Pelosi to moderate the next presidential debate. Political consultants and experts applauded the choice, insisting Pelosi is a cherished figure widely known for her fair and balanced approach to politics.
<p> &quot;We think that Pelosi is by far the best choice to ensure an informative and productive debate between the candidates,&quot; said Commission Director Rumplestiltskin Mouldyneck. &quot;It&#x27;s important that these debates remain nonpartisan. We are here to ensure Americans get straight facts on what a stinky no-good yucky man Donald Trump is.&quot;
<p> According to sources, Pelosi has accepted the invitation. She will give Donald Trump 12 seconds to answer each question, after which a loud siren will go off and a bucket of dead fish will fall from the ceiling on Trump&#x27;s head to indicate he has reached his time limit.
<p> &quot;I am so pleased, so proud, to accept the position of moderator for the American people,&quot; she said. &quot;I predict this will be a very fair and informative debate for everyone involved. I look forward to showing everyone how unfit Trump is to serve, but in a very fair and balanced way. Also, I hope he dies!&quot;
<p> The commission has also announced they have invited little-known journalist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to moderate the final debate.
