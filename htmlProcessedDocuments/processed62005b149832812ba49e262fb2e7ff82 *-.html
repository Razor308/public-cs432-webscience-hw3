<h> About This Site
<p> The 2K ADBA is the Amateur Draft Basketball Association. We are an NBA 2K Competitive Draft League and Bring Your Own Team League. We have multiple leagues throughout the 2K season, as well as raffles, tournaments, and community events. The ADBA was built to create a community for people to meet other 2K players, prepare for the NBA 2K league combine, and have a competitive place to play.
