<p> Speaking personally and frankly, Sir David explained, &quot;We are going to have to live more economically than we do. And we can do that and, I believe we will do it more happily, not less happily. And that the excesses the capitalist system has brought us, have got to be curbed somehow.&quot;
<p> &quot;That doesn&#x27;t mean to say that capitalism is dead and I&#x27;m not an economist and I don&#x27;t know. But I believe the nations of the world, ordinary people worldwide, are beginning to realise that greed does not actually lead to joy.&quot;
<p> Sir David said when we help the natural world, it becomes a better place for everyone and in the past, when we lived closer to nature, the planet was a &quot;working eco-system in which everybody had a share&quot;.

<p> The 10-part podcast is being released on the second anniversary of the publication of a key scientific report on global warming.
<p> The podcast series explores issues and solutions around climate change, and features the BBC environment correspondent, Matt McGrath, and science correspondent, Vic Gill, along with interviews with well-known names like Idris Elba, Lily Cole and Jay Blades.
<p> The IPCC special report, released in October 2018 didn&#x27;t &quot;save the planet&quot; but it may yet prove to be the most critical moment in the story of climate change.
<p> The study made two things very clear. The first was that there was a massive difference in keeping the rise in global temperatures this century to 1.5C as opposed to 2C.
<p> Politicians had for years focussed on the higher number - the special report made clear that was a risky strategy, which could see the end of coral reefs and expose millions of people to the threat of floods.
<p> The second key message from the IPCC was that the world could stay under 1.5C if carbon emissions were essentially slashed in half by 2030.
<p> The urgency of the challenge laid out in the report inspired millions of young people to take action. This pressure is filtering up to politicians.
<p> Sir David also spoke about his frustrations with the postponement of COP26, in Glasgow, the UN&#x27;s major climate change conference.
<p> He called the pandemic &quot;a disaster for all of us&quot; saying it&#x27;s depressing that every time we get to a moment to do something about climate change, it&#x27;s delayed to another year.
<p> The broadcasting legend also spoke about giving up the &quot;busyness&quot; of things like travelling and meetings.
<p> &quot;We&#x27;ve had time to sit down and suddenly you realise out there in the park or if I&#x27;m lucky enough, in the garden, there&#x27;s a bird singing and I&#x27;ve not heard that for a bit â€¦ and that lifts the spirit to an extraordinary degree and you begin to realise, what is really important&quot;.
