<p> Few more minutes that&#x27;s. He would start sleeping with me like from the moment I slept till the moment I woke up. He was always there. Did you have good dreams? You did pyramid. I love you. I would look over at him and I&#x27;ll be like good morning and then he&#x27;ll just look at me and he&#x27;ll yell back. I&#x27;m like that was a good morning too like okay. So then I would do it everyday Good morning. Kermit Oh, really. Good night. Okay, you tease me. Can you get off of me? Okay, I don&#x27;t mind for him to respond. I know it probably sounds weird but talking to the cat and answering back. It&#x27;s just amazing like he really understands me. I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like that. Before Kermit life was pretty difficult, I was going through some trauma and my mom. She&#x27;s like how about we look into like adopting a cat. Even going through like the there was just like that moment where like you&#x27;re talking to someone they&#x27;re saying all the right things, but you don&#x27;t want to say the right things and. I know it looks like a adopted, but I feel like he came into my life at the moment that I needed him the most. He&#x27;s somebody that I can always talk to and I&#x27;m not gonna get any judgement from. Kermit you ready to go to bed? Yeah. Can I get a kiss? Oh ready to go to bed. Let&#x27;s go. Okay. Come on. Yeah. I&#x27;m ready. Let&#x27;s go. we look like twins. You. My favorite part is just talking to him because I know he&#x27;ll have something to say. He&#x27;s he&#x27;s changed so much in my life. I&#x27;m so grateful for him so grateful.
