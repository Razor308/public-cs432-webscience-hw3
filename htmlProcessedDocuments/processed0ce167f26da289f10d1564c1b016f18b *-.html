<p> You know what, I&#x27;m probably going to just have a breather this weekend... During the week, I wrapped up Super Mario Galaxy with a full 120 stars under my belt. I&#x27;d forgotten just how wonderful the game was, and with its new coat of HD paint boosting its appeal, it genuinely feels like it could have launched as a brand new Mario platformer this year and no one would have questioned it.
<p> Perhaps it&#x27;s partly down to the fact that I played the entire game docked with a Joy-Con in either hand, but it really reminded me of Super Mario Odyssey and made me want to revisit all of that game&#x27;s glorious kingdoms. Or, Nintendo could put out an Odyssey 2? Couldn&#x27;t you, Nintendo? I dare you.

<p> Hello. This weekend I‚Äôm going to spend the vast majority of my gaming time blasting through Ikenfell for review, I‚Äôm just a few hours in right now and am really enjoying it so far so look out for that verdict sometime soon. I‚Äôve also yet to get a go on Super Mario Bros. 35 so I‚Äôll be trying to squeeze a bit of a session in on that somewhere too.
<p> Elsewhere, I‚Äôve been busy honing my skills with a few of my favourite fighters in the rather sublime Rivals of Aether, sneaking in a run here and there on the magnificent Hades and am still working my way slowly through the mystery at the heart of the fantastic Paradise Killer. There are, quite literally, too many good games to play right now. I hope you all have a good weekend, whatever you‚Äôre playing, stay safe out there and wear a mask!

<p> Sorry, too busy with reviews to write anything here. Busy busy busy. Well, I supposed I&#x27;ve had time to revisit the DS and start a replay of the excellent, unknown Sgt Frog tie-in game Keroro Gunso the Super Movie: Gekishin Dragon Warriors de Arimasu! It&#x27;s an Inti Creates-developed platformer that takes its cues from Klonoa, of all things, with the same enemy manipulation and platforming mechanics as that MIA Namco series. It&#x27;s one of my favourite DS games, full stop, and nobody ever talks about it. Bah.
<p> Oh, I&#x27;ve also been wondering forlornly if Destiny 2 will ever hit the Switch, thus signalling the end of my life. But yes! Many reviews! Keep an eye out for them!

<p> This weekend I‚Äôll be doing my darnedest to put Rogue Legacy to bed before jumping fully onboard with Hades. I didn‚Äôt want to have two roguelikes on the go and I‚Äôve been having such a great time catching up with the former, but the latter is staring at me from the Switch home screen and I‚Äôm itching to spend some real time with it.
I‚Äôve also been lucky enough to get a preview code for an upcoming indie release that‚Äôs proven to be a total delight, so I‚Äôd like to spend a bit more time with that ‚Äì look out for more news next week.

<p> I have taken a new ship, converting it into a sort of miner/cargo hauler thingy and am now merrily making ends meet by flying trough asteroid fields in search of gold, diamonds, pure water and even the odd alien artefact. Yep, Rebel Galaxy Outlaw continues to rule my weekends in a welcome fashion.
<p> The unexpected stealth release of Super Arcade Racing along with the delightful Falcon Age and the upcoming Foregone make up the rest of the schedule. Above all else, I need to wrap up my music album release for next week.
<p> Ryan can list the first 151 Pok√©mon all in order off by heart ‚Äì a feat he calls his ‚Äòparty trick‚Äô despite being such an introvert that he‚Äôd never be found anywhere near a party. He‚Äôd much rather just have a night in with Mario Kart and a pizza, and we can‚Äôt say we blame him.
<p> I recently restarted Paper Mario Thousand Year Door with the aim of finishing. Currently playing the part of the Great Gonzales. Been reminded just how great the characters and writing were.
<p> Also started up SD Gundam G Generation Genesis on the PS4 and need to fire up my Vita copy to allow for Cross Play. Although this does annoy me that the Switch version released later had no English subs...
<p> Will be carrying on with Ys Origins, which I am sadly finding a little underwhelming thus far, but I am hoping that it will pick up a bit. Finished 2nd a couple of times in Mario 35 last weekend, so will have a go at that too. And maybe some more Sunshine. Have a lovely weekend, all, and please stay safe out there.
<p> I&#x27;m STILL waiting for a patch for Ori and the Will of the Wisps, so I sadly won&#x27;t be playing that. What I have been playing is plenty of Hades. After 20 escape attempts and constantly making it with only a sliver away from defeating the final boss&#x27; 2nd health bar, I lost my patience and enabled God mode for that 20% damage reduction. It got to the point where the prospect of each new run was groan-inducing and felt like a chore, even though I was giving each run my 100% focus and effort. Say what you will, but it was worth enabling it, as it made the game fun again. I&#x27;ve got nothing to prove, especially when you need to beat the game 11 times or so to see the full ending, apparently. Since enabling God mode, my last 2 escape attempts were successful (just barely, though. The mode hasn&#x27;t broken the game).
<p> Aside from Hades, I&#x27;m not sure what I want to play. I was thinking of starting Ys Origin, but it&#x27;s such a fast paced hack and slash like Hades that i don&#x27;t want to feel burned out. I&#x27;m also expecting my Shantae and the Seven Sirens to come in from LRG. If it arrived, I totally would have started that.
<p> Must... finish... Thumper........ with all &#x27;S&#x27; grades for some horrible reason... before it kills me. But also, I finally got around to buying Panzer Dragoon: Remake, so maybe I&#x27;ll just play that again and remember a simpler time.
<p> I&#x27;ve started on Mario Maker 2 - really enjoying the creativity of the story mode levels and getting to grips with the course creator. As always with these sorts of things my imagination gets carried away far beyond what I&#x27;ll actually create given how little time I have for games nowadays, but the ideas and plans are half the fun anyway.
<p> Also a bit of DK on snes online and mario maker 35. A very ninty focused weekend all told
<p> Besides at least some of the usual suspects, I&#x27;m still trying to claw my way through Zombie Panic in Wonderland - a lot of fun but expectedly more insane by the stage - I was even forced to give up on the touchscreen (which certainly allows quicker aiming than the right stick crosshair/cursor) because I can&#x27;t keep up with the barrage of projectiles anyway, thus needing my right thumb on the dodge roll button instead. I&#x27;ve also got my hands on Little Nightmares and Bomber Crew this week and looking forward to spending more time with both.
<p> Outside Nintendoland, I may do dome Remote Play as well - I&#x27;m still trying to clumsily race in Payback despite the umpteenth control scheme burn (everything else is still proving to be right up my alley), and I might turn to a casual round of NFS Rivals or GTA 5 afterwards, just to balance the associated frustration with the healthy shoulder button driving.üòÜ Might even advance some of the Nights of Azure or Uncharted playthroughs while connected.
<p> Got Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 after the NL review. Been playing it a but this morning. Please don&#x27;t buy this game! The controls are really bad and the camra has a mind of its own. It juat took 20 mins to make a very basic coaster cos the controlls are so bad.
<p> Zelda BotW. Got the Master Sword before facing any of the divine beast, but I only got it so I don&#x27;t have to waste my shrine guardian weapons against Guardian Stalkers to obtain Ancient weapons (and armor) from Robie. I prefer exploring and continuing the story without farming excessively. Still love this game. Also obtained Revali&#x27;s Gale.
<p> I may later continue playing Fire Emblem Awakening since I have some Mad King that needs to be stopped from destroying Ylisse.
<p> Finished Luigis Mansion 3 this week and honestly? Found it be a bit of a chore from halfway through. The controls and gameplay were fun but I just found it so repetitive. Deciding whether to start Pokemon Shield or Undertale next
<p> Super Mario Sunshine, should have 100% by Monday which will mean I&#x27;m done with 3D Allstars. The updated graphics on Sunshine are awesome, compared it to the GameCube version and it&#x27;s like night and day.Might go for Wario The Shake Dimension on Wii next or a Need For Speed game.
<p> Gone back to Animal Crossing lately. With the recent October update, the Halloween themed items have given me the incentive I needed to jump back on.
<p> Recently downloaded Resident Evil 5 in the sale, so im playing that too. I needed a new playthrough as its been a fair few years and whilst its not true Resident Evil, in its own right, its quite a good game.
<p> If I have any time spare, then I might have a couple of rounds of Super Mario 35 to cap it all off! üòÑüëç
<p> I just bought a used copy of Odyssey and played hours and hours if it yesterday! I never managed to finish a single Mario game and I&#x27;m terrible at platforming, so I don&#x27;t know why I even bought it in the first place, but that game is so good! Every single Moon makes me smile! I think it&#x27;s exactly what I needed after a long work week.
<p> I&#x27;m very late to the party but I got a copy of Breath of the Wild. It was never in stores where o lived for some reason. It&#x27;s truly a masterpiece. I will be playing that and watching Promised Neverland
<p> Just finished with 120 stats/shines in all three Mario allstars games so I started playing Hades. After that I am planning to play Alwa&#x27;s Legacy and I am ready to jump into the Lonely Mountains:Downhill (GOTY 2019) DLC Eldfjall as soon as it is released.
<p> Last weekend I got the minimum 70 stars to beat Galaxy 2. I wanted to leave the majority of the game fresh for a possible Switch version. I then 100%ed 3D Land as both brothers (that last level without using a Tanooki suit was really hard). I had a ridiculous amount of fun with 3D Land. Here&#x27;s hoping it&#x27;s in maybe a volume 2 of 3D All-Stars. I then spent half of this week 100%ing New Super Mario Bros 2. Now I&#x27;m on Sticker Star, and...I don&#x27;t hate it...but my enjoyment of it varies. There are times when I have fun exploring and solving puzzles and other times where I just feel like the game is incredibly padded out. It&#x27;s also weird to me how different the design philosophies were between this and say Dream Team which came out half a year later. Dream Team annoys me by explaining too much while Sticker Star often annoys me by explaining too little. I do find the sticker collection aspect to be oddly addicting though. I also really enjoy finding all the random real world objects scattered around the game and seeing what they do in battle as stickers.
<p> Switch: Super Mario Odyssey - Fully opened up the Metro Kingdom, looking around for more Moons before going to the next area.
3DS: Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser&#x27;s Minions - I&#x27;ve started searching for the Beanstar and unlocked World 5 in the Minions portion.
Mobile: Pokemon Go - Just a bit of this when I&#x27;m out and about.
<p> @Stevethejedi I agree with you on LM3, was a bit underwhelmed given the reviews and love for the series, though i found the final few floors more enjoyable. Pity really.
<p> On topic, I&#x27;ll be mainly swapping between Super Mario 35 (so many 2nds, need to get a 1st), and collecting ninji speedrun medals on Mario Maker 2. Might drop in on Smash Ultimate and the ¬£2 copy of Fifa 19 I picked up today!
<p> Playing Mario Odissey again in portable mode and waiting for Black Friday to complete my collection of exclusive Nintendo games.I still lack CaptainToad and Yoshi&#x27;s Crafted World.E-shops in Brazil and Mexico always with the best prices.
<p> Sunshine on the Switch front, just got Blue Coins and Corona Mountain left for the 120 shines playthrough. Also more XB1 stuff while saving the rest of 3D All Stars for 2021 droughts (Sunshine was the exciting part of 3D All Stars because I haven&#x27;t played it in nearly a decade due to hardware requirements).
<p> Im kind of in a rut. I‚Äôve got a ton of games I need to finish but I‚Äôm stuck in endless loops of breeding Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Shield and matches of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate with my cousin (plus I‚Äôm trimming all my replays in preparation for update 9.0). I‚Äôve finished 64 and Sunshine to 100% on Super Mario 3D All-Stars, and I‚Äôm 70 stars into Galaxy, though I‚Äôm feeling a bit of 3D Mario fatigue at this point. I really need to go back and finish Hollow Knight and Astral Chain, though, and I‚Äôm hoping to find inspiration to pick those up again soon.
<p> I dug out my XBox 360 from the closet to play Dragon Age 2 (will follow with Inquisition). I&#x27;ve been needing a Bioware fix and I don&#x27;t want to go through Mass Effect in case that rerelease is imminent.
<p> As for Nintendo, I just finished Galaxy&#x27;s 120 stars (with Mario at least) so I might play around in Mario 64 again or maybe even Odyssey. Problem is, do I start all over again in Odyssey or just keep trying to find existing moons? There are waaaay too many!
<p> Currently swapping between Animal Crossing: New Horizons prepping for Hallowe‚Äôen and doing the fishing tourney as well as playing through Phoenix Wright: Dual Destinies that I recently bought on 3DS. Been meaning to get around playing that for a while now.
<p> Still playing 3D Allstars on Switch with 100 stars/shines in each game. On 3DS I&#x27;m playing OoT 3D for the millionth time, just because. At home I&#x27;m playing Galaxy 2 on my Wii U and Banjo Kazooie on my N64. I&#x27;ll probably end up playing through Super Mario Bros 2 on my RetroUSB AVS, as well.
<p> Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for the NA open tournament, as well as more Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Super Mario Bros. 35. Will be playing Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair too, since I just got that game on sale a couple days ago. Maybe some Super Mario Galaxy 2, as well.
<p> Got all 120 stars in Super Mario 64, so now I am moving on to my favorite of the bunch, Super Mario Sunshine. Also, I will surely spend some time in my usual go-to games, SSBU, MK8 Deluxe, and my newest obsession, Super Mario Bros. 35. I am now searching for a second win, and dreading when it gets taken down. After I am done with Sunshine, I have been wanting to replay Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Dior on GameCube, but it will probably be at least a couple weeks before that happens.
<p> Managed to finish of Paper Mario Origami King a few days ago, the game had bit of an identity crisis for sure and it also falls to the same pitfall as every Paper Mario game I&#x27;ve played where a part of it felt like filler, still it was a charming game with fun exploration and with an exceptionally solid soundtrack and you do get pretty far with me with just that.
<p> Started Langrisser 1/2 collection back again a few days ago and started playing the 2nd game of the compilation, while mostly similar, structutally it seems more interesting with its seemingly more refined split route system and the map design seems a bit more interesting and eventful as well so far.
<p> I bought smash bros when it came out, and played it for a couple of days then started playing something else. A video randomly popped up on my YouTube the other day from frostbite smash bros tournament and I put it back on again and loving it!!! Cant believe it&#x27;s been sat in my drawer for so long. Unfortunately everyone else has been playing it for so long I&#x27;m gonna get thrashed online......
<p> I will probably try to continue Paper Mario: Origami King.
The graphics and the level designs in this game is so colourful and just gorgeous to look at. The storyline keeps me so far interested, There`s a lot of funny conversations with many of the characters in this game. According to some game-reviewers, the battles are a bit harder/different from some of the earlier and former Paper Mario titles (..but dont let that scare you away. It`s still a wonderful and a joy of an RPG-game to play). I am really enjoying it so far! X)
<p> Okami. I was on it heavy until I found out Roller Coaster Tyson 3 was out, and was actually good! I‚Äôm about 30 hours into Okami. I want to have it done by Monday. I have a digital backlog and I‚Äôm ready to move on. Still love Okami, though! I‚Äôve also gotten the hang of playing RCT 3 on the Switch. It was painful! üòÇ
<p> I meant to start Mario Sunshine but with the little playing time I‚Äôve gotten- I booted up PicZle Lines DX again lol. Still trying to finish up the last dinosaur puzzle pack! I did download the Pok√©mon 3 demo so I‚Äôll give that a try this weekend too.Have a great weekend everyone!
<p> I hit a break after beating Anodyne and... I literally couldn&#x27;t figure out which game to tackle in my backlog lol! I decided to go for something a little slower, so I chose Football Game. I will probably couple this with Hotline Miami 2 and Framed 2, or just play it straight through since it isn&#x27;t supposed to be that long.
<p> It will pretty much be wrapping up the few hospitals in 2 point hospital, then maybe some ACNH to finish decorating my island, and then if i get time trying to get past that stupid boat ride in paper mario origami king lol
