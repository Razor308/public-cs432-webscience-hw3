<h> Quiet in the Gulf, no immediate concerns elsewhere
<p> HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- There are two areas of potential development we are keeping our eye on, but nothing immediately concerning.
<p> The first area of disturbed weather is located about 600 miles east-southeast of Bermuda has a medium (40%) chance of tropical development during the next five days. Gradual tropical or subtropical development of this system is possible through the middle of next week while the system meanders over the central Atlantic well to the southeast of Bermuda.
<p> Another system we are watching is expected to form early next week over the southwestern Caribbean. Formation chance is low (30%) during the next five days. Some gradual development of this system will be possible through the middle of next week while it remains nearly stationary over the southwestern Caribbean Sea.
<p> Outside of these two waves, it&#x27;s quiet in the tropics.
<p> Hurricane season officially ends on the last day of November, but Texans can usually breathe a sigh of relief by mid-October once the jet stream shifts and fall cold fronts start pushing through the Lone Star State. We are almost there!
<p> You&#x27;ll still want to continue to stay prepared and have your hurricane preparedness plan in place, just in case.
