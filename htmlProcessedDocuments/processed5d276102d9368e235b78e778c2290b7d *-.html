<p> To keep the review short and sweet, Sniper:Ghost Warrior is a fun and enjoyable game but it leaves the player a little short when compared to Call Of Duty Black OPS, or Battlefield Bad Company. The problem lies in the multiplayer function, a player&#x27;s avatar routinely gets stuck on objects within the map and the multiplayer function is heavily depended on one&#x27;s ping rate (lagging to the point where youâ€™re a sitting duck). This is the first time I have experienced such a low internet signal. In most occasions my internet signal is maxed out, but when I play Sniper: Ghost Warrior my internet signal is severely diminished, only to be maxed out again when I switch back to Black OPS or Bad Company. Maybe it&#x27;s where the server&#x27;s are being hosted but it really does discourage on line game play. All in all, I would suggest this game to any person looking for a fun first person shooter game.
<p> The game and story line was awesome but the assault team was not about the game. The game is called Sniper Ghost Warrior. It would be awesome if you can be the sniper and protect the assult team. But outside of that everything else was fine. Thanks for your time and reading this.
<p> The graphics are really good, the forest and vegetations are amazing. The ballistic system is fantastic and the difficulty of the game is challenging. The multiplayer experience is not so interesting as on other games, but is a different experience that worths some hours. The history is not so envolving, a simple plot without much surprises. Who likes sniper, as myself, will love this game.
