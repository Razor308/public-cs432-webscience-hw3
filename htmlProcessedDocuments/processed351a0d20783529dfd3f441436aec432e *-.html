<p> The first son and campaign surrogate to his father, President Donald Trump, attacked former Vice President Joe Biden in a tweet on Thursday that appeared to refute reality — and which quickly sparked bewilderment online.
<p> He spoke after the president said he would no longer participate in a debate against Mr Biden next week, citing the debate commission’s announcement that it would change the event to be virtual instead of in-person following his Covid-19 diagnosis.
<p> “So Biden refuses to debate @realDonaldTrump face to face but will appear in person for a town hall,” The first son wrote, adding: “What a coward.”
<p> The tweet did not make sense, given the fact that Mr Biden accepted an invitation to next week’s previously scheduled debate and his campaign agreed with the commission’s decision to make it virtual.
<p> Mr Biden said he would debate the president next week, but supported the commission’s decision to make it a virtual event after it was reported Mr Trump contracted the novel coronavirus just days after the two took the stage during the first president debate last week.
<p> The tweet was puzzling, seemingly making the stretch that because Mr Biden did not want to stand within close proximity to an active Covid-19 patient, he was apparently “refusing” to debate the president. Mr Biden will instead appear at a town hall the night the debate was originally scheduled.
<p> The first son has made several questionable claims along the campaign trail while stumping for his father, who has been inside of the White House ever since returning from Walter Reed Medical Center earlier this week, where he was flown after experiencing symptoms associated with the novel virus.
<p> Just yesterday it was reported the younger Trump told a North Dakota radio show his father “literally saved Christianity” during his years in the Oval Office.

<p> “The Democratic Party, the far left, has become the party of the ‘atheists,’ and they want to attack Christianity, they want to close churches, they’re totally fine keeping liquor stores open,” he claimed.
<p> Democrats have condemned recent statements from Trump allies claiming they were anti-Christianity or somehow against religion, with former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg taking to Fox News to discuss the issue on Fox News.
<p> In the interview with the conservative news outlet, Mr Buttigieg said: “If people want to play that game, we can look in to why an evangelical Christian like Mike Pence wants to be on a ticket with a president caught with a porn star.
<p> Not nearly as much spin was required for his now-viral counterpoint.
