<p> Joe Biden once again refused to reveal his stance on packing the Supreme Court, saying voters &#x27;don&#x27;t deserve&#x27; to know his position ahead of the November election.
<p> The Democratic nominee reiterated his stance during an interview on Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada, while taking questions from the media.

<p> KTNV reporter Ross DiMattei approached Biden and confessed that viewers were anxious to know if he supported expanding the Supreme Court to more than nine judges.

<p> &#x27;He&#x27;s about to make a pick in the middle of an election, first time it&#x27;s ever been done, first time in history it&#x27;s ever been done.
<p> Meanwhile, Biden appeared at a campaign event on Saturday in Erie, Pennsylvania, delivering a 30-minute speech hitting President Donald Trump on the economy.
<p> &#x27;Anyone who actually does an honest day´s work sees him and his promises for what they are,&#x27; Biden said at a training facility for plumbers and other tradespeople.
<p> &#x27;The president can only see the world from Park Avenue. I see it from Scranton,&#x27; he said.
<p> The president has argued that Biden´s tax and energy policies would cripple industrial state economies, especially energy-producing states like Pennsylvania. He has accused Biden of plans to ban fracking, although Biden has proposed only barring new leases on federal land, a fraction of U.S. fracking operations.
<p> But as Biden tried to put the spotlight on economic issues, questions about the future of the Supreme Court continued to loom large ahead of the election.
<p> Following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September, the Trump administration immediately signaled its intention to nominate and confirm a new Supreme Court Justice by the November election.
<p> This outraged Democrats and a very slight number of Republicans who decried the quick turnaround. They argued that the next president - whether Trump is re-elected or Biden wins - should ultimately make the decision.
<p> Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the first Republican to dissent from her colleagues.
<p> Collins wrote in a statement: &#x27;In order for the American people to have faith in their elected officials, we must act fairly and consistently - no matter which political party is in power.
<p> &#x27;In fairness to the American people, who will either be re-electing the President or selecting a new one, the decision of a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court should be made by the President who is elected on November 3rd.&#x27;

<p> The notion of court packing has increasingly gained traction among some Democratic lawmakers in response to Republican&#x27;s rejection of Merrick Garland, a President Obama-era nominee.
<p> Obama nominated Garland for Supreme Court after the death of Antonin Scalia in 2016, but Republicans gave considerable push back and claimed that 237 days before an election was not enough time.
<p> Before he departed from Las Vegas on Friday, Biden answered questions about his view of court packing by criticizing conservatives&#x27; current efforts with Barrett.
<p> &#x27;Look, the only court packing is going on right now,&#x27; said Biden.
<p> &#x27;It&#x27;s going on with the Republicans packing the court now. It&#x27;s not constitutional what they&#x27;re doing. We should be focused on what&#x27;s happening right now.
<p> &#x27;And the fact is that the only packing going on is this court is being packed now by the Republicans after the vote has already begun. I&#x27;m going to stay focused on it so we don&#x27;t take our eyes off the ball here.&#x27;

<p> When asked about the revelation that Trump, who was infected with COVID-19 last week, would hold more campaign rallies, Biden urged the president to follow health guidelines.
<p> &#x27;I think it&#x27;s important that he make it clear to all the people that they should be socially distanced, they can be on the lawn, that&#x27;s fine.
<p> &#x27;But in fact, they should be socially distanced and wearing masks. That&#x27;s the only responsible thing to do.&#x27;
<p> Biden suggested the president confirm that he&#x27;s not infected, and the former vice president added that he underwent a COVID test that morning, His results were negative.
<p> Trump announced on Saturday that he would host two more rallies next week in Pennsylvania and Iowa.
