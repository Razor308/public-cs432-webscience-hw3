<p> &#x27;She definitely put it all out there on the line ... so much so, and so transparent, that you literally felt her pain.
<p> &#x27;I root for her,&#x27; Eva added. &#x27;I wish for nothing but the best and I hope to see NeNe back on the screen, where she belongs.
<p> Wishing her well: Marcille opened up about her relationship with Leakes, now that the latter has announced her departure from the hit Bravo show; NeNe seen on YouTube recently
<p> And when prompted about her beef with Leakes at the end of last season, the actress and mother-of-three remained positive and dignified:
<p> &#x27;Just let bygones be bygones. I was hurt about what happened, God has restored my friendships and others a hundred fold. I’m good.&#x27;
<p> Both Eva and RHOA veteran Cynthia Bailey, who also took part in the ET chat, kept coming back to the fact that in today&#x27;s era of a worldwide pandemic and reckoning with systemic and generations-old racism, Housewives drama is just &#x27;not that deep&#x27; anymore.
<p> &#x27;NeNe is TV gold,&#x27; Eva, who exited RHOA herself back in June, said. &#x27;There have only been a few reality stars that you say their name, and they represent an entire franchise&#x27;
<p> &#x27;Life is short,&#x27; Marcille reflected. &#x27;And unless it’s really something that you cannot get over, unless it’s a bell that cannot be un-rung, for me it’s not that deep. I have so much love and light with the friends that I have around me, who I speak to every day, my family.&#x27;
<p> Bailey, 53, shared similar thoughts, saying, &#x27;if the pandemic has taught us anything, it&#x27;s that life is too short. We took so much for granted.&#x27;
<p> And about her cohort NeNe, Cynthia called her &#x27;a strong woman.&#x27;
<p> Truth-telling: Both Eva and RHOA veteran Cynthia Bailey, who also took part in the chat, kept coming back to the fact that in today&#x27;s era of a worldwide pandemic and reckoning with systemic racism, Housewives drama is just &#x27;not that deep&#x27; anymore
<p> &#x27;You always have to give NeNe her props in terms of being one of the first, being on the forefront of the show, helping to create the platform so that someone like myself and Eva can be a part of it,&#x27; she also said.
<p> &#x27;She was great for the show. Even when we weren&#x27;t friends, even when she was coming for my wig, I still thought she was good for the show!&#x27;
<p> NeNe, meanwhile, remains embroiled in rather public feuds that involve both her now-former Real Housewives producer, Bravolebrity Andy Cohen, as well as ex-friend Wendy Williams.

<p> She recently revealed that she was not fired, but left the show after she was being &#x27;pushed out,&#x27; as she set the record straight on her departure and calling out Cohen and Bravo for racism.
<p> &#x27;I left because I was being pushed out,&#x27; NeNe told Extra last week, adding: &#x27;If you are working at McDonald&#x27;s, working 40 hours a week, they drop you down to 20 hours, they drop you down to 15, they drop you down to 10, it’s obvious that they want you to quit.
<p> &#x27;Something is very wrong with going from 18 or 23 episodes down to six… In the last four to five years, it has been less and less… Things just didn’t feel fair.&#x27;
<p> She also told ET Online: &#x27;I left the show. I had an offer on the table. I did not think the offer was a fair offer.&#x27;
<p> Calling out racism: She recently revealed that she was not fired, but left RHOA after she was being &#x27;pushed out,&#x27; as she set the record straight on her departure
<p> Leakes announced on YouTube in September that she was leaving, months after the new season began filming.
<p> She told her fans: &#x27;I have been on an extremely, extremely long, exhausting, tiring, emotional negotiation. There has been a lot of emotion flying from both sides. It has been hard.
<p> &#x27;And I have made the very hard and difficult decision to not be a part of The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Season 13. It wasn’t an easy decision for me. It was hard.&#x27;
<p> The Glee actress briefly deleted her Instagram back in August, when her 3.6million followers kept demanding an answer about her return.

<p> Bravo confirmed the news in a statement to Variety: &#x27;We wish Nene all the best in her future endeavors and thank her for sharing her journey for over a decade with the fans of The Real Housewives of Atlanta.
<p> &#x27;She’s been instrumental since the start and will truly be missed, and maybe one day she’ll hold the peach again.&#x27;
<p> Leakes most recently fired back at the network and Cohen over systemic racism, after he discussed her exit with Wendy Williams on Watch What Happens Live.
<p> Williams said when asked if she thinks Leakes is permanently leaving the show: &#x27;I believe that this is not a truth... NeNe has quit the show several times and you&#x27;ll have her back.
<p> &#x27;NeNe likes attention, dramatic attention. I don&#x27;t know what NeNe&#x27;s going to be doing for money, I&#x27;m not trying to count coins, but the Housewives is that one thing that all the girls use to promote their other stuff.&#x27;
