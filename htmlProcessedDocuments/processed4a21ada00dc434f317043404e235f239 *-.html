<h> A Short Hike sales “have been much stronger on Switch”
<p> After receiving a great deal of attention on PC, A Short Hike saw a surprise announcement and release on Switch. Thankfully, the game is performing well on Nintendo’s console thus far.
<p> Speaking about the reception on the system, A Short Hike creator Adam Robinson-Yu said that “so far the sales have been much stronger on Switch.” While we don’t have concrete data, we were told that “the PC release was much quieter by comparison.”
<p> Robinson-Yu also shared the following as to how the Switch port came to be:
<p> “Pretty much as soon as A Short Hike came out for PC, I started getting requests for a Switch port! I was also excited to get the game onto the console, but it ended up taking me a while. There was a lot more to do on the business side of things, which I wasn’t super prepared to handle. I also wanted to do the actual porting work myself, to make sure the port was at the quality I wanted it to be. It wasn’t super tough, but the whole process took much longer than I anticipated!”
<p> A Short Hike is out now on Switch as an eShop download. We’ll be sharing our full interview soon.
