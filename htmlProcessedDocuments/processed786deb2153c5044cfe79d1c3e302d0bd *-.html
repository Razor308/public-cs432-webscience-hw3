<p> The child ran off a trail Friday near Midway Geyser Basin on the park&#x27;s western side. The child slipped and fell into a small thermal feature, park officials said.
<p> The child was flown to a burn unit at Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center in Idaho Falls with second-degree burns to the lower body and back.
<p> Park officials were investigating. The child&#x27;s identity, condition and whether the child was a boy or girl weren&#x27;t immediately available.
<p> It was the second injury in a Yellowstone thermal feature this year. A woman backing up and taking photos fell into a hot spring or fumarole near Old Faithful Geyser in May.
<p> The woman had entered the park illegally while it was closed due to the coronavirus.
<p> In Sept. 2019, a man suffered severe burns after falling into thermal water near the cone of the Old Faithful Geyser.
<p> Park officials stressed that the ground in hydrothermal areas around Yellowstone is fragile and thin, and there&#x27;s scalding water just below the surface. Officials say visitors should always remain on boardwalks and trails and should use extreme caution around thermal features.
