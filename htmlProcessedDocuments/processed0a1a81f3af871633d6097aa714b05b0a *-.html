<h> Trump says he would &quot;love&quot; to donate plasma
<p> President Trump said Friday that he plans to donate plasma after battling COVID-19. During his first on-camera interview since being diagnosed with coronavirus last week, the president also said that he is &quot;medication-free&quot; but that he doesn&#x27;t know the results of his most recent coronavirus test.
<p> About donating plasma, he said &quot;I will. Nobody&#x27;s asked me that question, actually, but I will. If that&#x27;s, if they want me to do it, I&#x27;d love to do it,&quot; the commander-in-chief told Fox News during a remote interview from the White House.
<p> In convalescent plasma therapy, doctors collect plasma from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and give it to patients who are still fighting to survive. It has been used across the country as a treatment for COVID-19 after the Food and Drug Administration approved its use in August.
<p> FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in August that early trials indicated a 35% better chance of survival when convalescent plasma is used in &quot;optimal patients.&quot; Potential donors must have previously tested positive for COVID-19 and have since recovered, having had no symptoms for at least two weeks.
<p> The president revealed that when he checked into Walter Reed Medical Center, he &quot;didn&#x27;t feel vert strong&quot; and &quot;didn&#x27;t feel like the president of the U.S. should feel.&quot; He said that he had congestion in his lungs during his hospital stay, but added that, &quot;with each day, it got better.&quot;
<p> He said he didn&#x27;t have difficulty breathing â€” despite that he was put on supplemental oxygen.
<p> During the interview, Mr. Trump also addressed the criticism he faced for briefly leaving Walter Reed on Sunday to wave to supporters who gathered outside the hospital, saying he was &quot;very glad&quot; he did it. He said his Secret Service members were &quot;very protected.&quot;
<p> &quot;After two days, I said, &#x27;You know, I want to go out and say hello to the people,&#x27;&quot; he said. &quot;And I went to Secret Service. And these are the people that are with me all the time. And they said, &#x27;We have no problem, sir.&#x27; I said, &#x27;I just want to take a drive by them and just wave.&#x27;&quot;
<p> &quot;It was a great display of love out there,&quot; Mr. Trump said. &quot;I don&#x27;t think there was one negative person, and there were many, many, many people.&quot;
<p> The president left Walter Reed on Monday after a three-night stay, returning to the White House. He said Regeneron&#x27;s experimental antibody cocktail made a &quot;tremendous difference&quot; in his recovery.
<p> On Thursday, White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said the president completed his treatment for COVID-19, clearing him to return to his public duties. Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold his first public event on Saturday, speaking from the South Lawn balcony on Saturday about &quot;law and order,&quot; in what the White House is calling a &quot;peaceful protest&quot; expected to draw hundreds of people.
