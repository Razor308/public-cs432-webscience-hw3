<p> WASHINGTON, D.C.â€”In what&#x27;s being hailed as a 14-dimensional Go move, President Trump added a Black Lives Matter decal to his SUV so he can take as many trips outside the hospital as he wants, and the media won&#x27;t be able to claim he&#x27;s spreading COVID.
<p> With his newfound freedom, Trump instructed his motorcade to drive around the city. The president waved at supporters -- referred to as &quot;peaceful protesters&quot; -- and stopped at the drive-in to catch Tenet. He even shared a bucket of popcorn with Secret Service agents, and not a single reporter was able to claim he was spreading the virus, thanks to his handy decal.
<p> &quot;Well, that was a bust,&quot; Trump said as his Chevy Suburban pulled out of the movie theater to take him back to the hospital. &quot;That didn&#x27;t make any sense at all. Did I need to understand Interstellar to make heads or tails of that? What a terrible movie. We should have seen Trolls.&quot;
