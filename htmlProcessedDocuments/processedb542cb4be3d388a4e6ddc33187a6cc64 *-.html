<h> Genshin Impact New Regions Update Order Confirmed By miHoYo, New Characters Teased
<h> miHoYo revealed in which order we&#x27;ll get to explore the new regions of Genshin Impact. New characters from each region were teased as well.
<p> DualShockers recently had the opportunity to interview the Genshin Impact development team at miHoYo. The game is out now on PC, PS4, mobile, and currently has two vast regions to explore, Mondstadt and Liyue. miHoYo confirmed the next region to be added is the Japan-themed Inazuma. Moreover, in a recently revealed trailer, miHoYo actually listed in which order each of the new regions of Teyvat should be added to Genshin Impact via future updates.
<p> The trailer features each of the main story acts that will be included in Genshin Impact. Each story arc will be focused on one of the seven regions of Teyvat, ruled by one of the seven Archon. Each segment also reveals a character from the region.
<p> The trailer lists all the regions of Teyvat in Genshin Impact in this order:
<p> Diluc and Ningguang are already in the game. The character appearing in the Inazuma Chapter segment, Ayaka Kamisato, was actually already playable in the first Closed Beta Test. She wasn’t reintegrated into the game since though. All the other characters are new.
<p> It’s technically not officially confirmed yet if each Genshin Impact major update will each bring one of these new story chapters and region. We could get more content between each. The fact that the final Act isn’t numbered might also hint that there will be more Acts after Act VI before reaching the final Act.
<p> The trailer is narrated by Bough Keeper Dainsleif, who was first revealed at TGS 2020, is voiced by Kenjiro Tsuda, most notably famous for voicing Seto Kaiba in Yugioh. Recently, he also dubbed Sam Bridges / in the Japanese dub of Death Stranding.
<p> Soon after the launch of Genshin Impact, multiple Japanese players claimed the game was “spyware” or was executing clipboard snooping. miHoYo denied both of these allegations and explained in detail what actually happened. The issues were both unintentional, and have now been resolved.
