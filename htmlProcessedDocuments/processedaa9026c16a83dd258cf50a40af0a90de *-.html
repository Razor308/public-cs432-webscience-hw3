<p> With a new season in Animal Crossing: New Horizons comes new crafting recipes and materials. We don&#x27;t know about you, but we can&#x27;t wait to see our islands dressed up in warm tones and all kinds of spoopy decor. To celebrate, we&#x27;ve pulled together comprehensive lists of all things fall (or &#x27;autumnal&#x27;, if you like) for your reference, so that you can make the most of this new season on your own island.
<h> When is the fall season in Animal Crossing: New Horizons?
<p> In all Animal Crossing games, autumn officially begins on September 1st in the northern hemisphere, and lasts through November 25th. If you&#x27;re playing in the southern hemisphere in New Horizons, however, fall begins on March 1st, and runs through May 25th.
<p> However, the most beloved parts of the change in seasons in New Horizons are definitely the updated recipes, items and furniture series available to forage and craft.

<p> Austin started gaming at 2 years old and has been addicted ever since. Her Zelda, Mario, Pok√©mon &amp; Animal Crossing obsessions freak people out. She habitually carries a mini projector around to play her Switch in console mode in weird places. Her favorite gaming snack is pizza rolls, because greasy controllers are her bugaboo.
<p> I saw the Mush Partition in one of the early game trailers before the game released. I thought it was some kind of massive mushroom that could grow. Nope, just furniture. It&#x27;s still cool, but some child-like wonder has been lost.
