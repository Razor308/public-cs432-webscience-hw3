<p> D.C. has been deadly this weekend, with five people killed in shootings that happened on Friday and Saturday. It is part of five death in less than 24-hours and nine since October 3, according to D.C. Police.
<p> The latest three shooting deaths came Saturday around 2 p.m. at two separate locations in Northeast D.C. One was in the 1700 block of Irving Street and the other was in the 4500 block of Quarles Street.
<p> Police said Saturday evening there are no suspects for either shooting and the circumstances surrounding the shootings are unknown.
<p> “You feel like it may be okay to let the kids go out for a few hours to play out in the front yard, or the backyard at two or three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, what could wrong? Well on 17th St. people get shot,” Meka Robinson said.
<p> Robinson said her mother lives near Irving St. and heard the gunshots around two in the afternoon.
<p> “She said I just heard about eight to ten gunshots. I said are you all okay, are you all okay, she’s like yeah I&#x27;m in the kitchen under the sink,” Robinson recounted. “And my son is here with her, she told my son to go somewhere and get on the floor.”
<p> Robinson said it’s really sad that these shootings are becoming the norm, adding her mother lives in a nice, quiet neighborhood.
<p> “Whenever you see the yellow tape you just know that something horrible has happened,” Robinson said. “You don&#x27;t really have to know what or who, when you see the yellow tape, you know something horrible has happened.”
