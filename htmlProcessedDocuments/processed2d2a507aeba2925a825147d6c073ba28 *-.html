<p> I used to have this game back in high school until someone broke into my friends place and stole it when he was borrowing it. Was such a tragic loss as it was one of my favourites. But now thanks to you I now have the chance to relive that part of my childhood and I was not disappointed! Graphics haven&#x27;t stood the test of time but I was instantly immersed in it, Thank you very much, Rated 5 stars.
<p> I bought this game when it first came out and I played it non stop. The graphics are a bit grainy, but the gameplay is smooth. The missions objectives are clear, yet far from easy to complete.
I enjoyed the realistic missions that are presented in this game. From the first mission, Not one step back, to the end; you&#x27;ll enjoy this game.
The AI this game uses for it&#x27;s computer oppenents, The Nazis, is incredible. You can play this game over and over again, I did, and not have one play the same as the last!
The maps are incredible. In one mission, you have to get to the tractor factory using the sewer system. There are so many side tunnels that I found several places I had not been before during previous plays.
The weapons are great too. My favorite is the Mosin Nagant Sniper Rifle. It is great to get in so close and snipe down a Panzerschreck from the window of the tractor factory just after the Nazi has come around the side of the building unaware!
My favorite mission has to be The Bridge at Remaggen though. I guess because my grandfather was really there and the way he described how it was, I feel as though the creators of this game have done a wonderful job. Fighting your way across a half blown up bridge against overwhelming odds. A hundred Nazis coming for you, Machine gun nests firing at you, Snipers shooting at you and all that&#x27;s between you and the Almighty is the weapon in your hands and the steel supports of the bridge. If you manage to make your way across the bridge, you still have the tower to deal with, filled with Nazis hiding in every corner and around every bend of the staircase. If you make it to the top of the tower then you still have to repel the Stuka bombers attack!
A perfect game on every level!! I give this game a 6/5!!!!!
<p> Reviewed for Big Boss Games by: L.E.G.
As a lover and avid player of FPS (First Person Shooter) type games, I am probably one of the toughest critics and a game must satisfy all my criteria for me to give it a 5/5 rating. Without any doubts, Call of Duty Finest Hour has successfully accomplished this lofty goal.
To start with, Call of Duty Finest Hour is entirely based on events that happened during World War II. But, ActiVision took on a bigger role than just making a video game and actually tries and succeeds in teaching us a brief history lesson. Granted it&#x27;s very short and concise, but it helps to setup the game and it&#x27;s many diverse and challenging levels.
You start out playing as a member of the Russian Army fighting with your comrades on the Eastern Front, from the Volga to Stalingrad. The missions can be somewhat difficult to finish, but the squad leader does give you instructions (just as if you were in the army) on what you need to do or where you need to go. &quot;Blow up that building&quot; and &quot;Take out those machine guns&quot; are typical fare. And most of the time you are a member of a &quot;squad&quot;, so don&#x27;t try to be all &quot;Rambo&quot; and try to defeat the Germans all by yourself. You will get slaughtered!
After you complete your mission(s) as one person, you are then placed in someone else’s shoes and get to fight the war from their perspective. Which also opens you up to using different weapons and driving around in tanks. But, this is not Grand Theft Auto. You can&#x27;t go around and jump in vehicles and take off. Your tour of duty on the Eastern Front with the Russians takes a total of 8 sometimes-grueling missions. At least the game is very forgiving and lets you restart the mission at the last checkpoint.
After the Eastern Front, you are whisked off to North Africa to serve with the British Army in Tunisia. All of the buildings and backgrounds used in this game are simply amazing. There is a lot of rich and articulate detail to keep your attention. You will serve a total of 4 missions with the bulldogs. More neat weapons used by the Brits and a lot of blowing stuff up in these levels. G-D Save the Queen!
And last, but not least, you go to the Western Front to fight with the American Army. As in previous levels, you get more awesome weapons to shoot and tanks to drive. Some of the toughest battles will be fought with the Americans. A total of 7 missions await your shooting skills.
Call of Duty Finest Hour by ActiVision is available for the Playstation 2, Xbox and Gamecube. It is rated &quot;T&quot; for Teen and contains a ton of blood and a whole lot of violence. Since this game is based on World War II, blood and violence is to be expected. Total missions are 19 and 23 different weapons.
This game is Single Player only, but does offer multiplayer online broadband only and 2-16 players. Online gametypes are: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Search &amp; Destroy.
Overall, this game was as close to perfect as they can get with very few technical glitches. Like one time I was crawling around on the floor and trying to climb a flight of stairs and my character just fell through some empty space to his terrible death.
This game was just so well balanced between missions, story, music and action that I had to give it a 5/5.
It&#x27;s really an awesome game, so go ahead and get a copy.
