<p> Though they can&#x27;t put their love into words, dogs have an unexpectedly large repertoire of ways to show they care.
<p> From subtle body language to over-the-top displays of affection, your pooch is probably showering you with devotion in plenty of surprising ways.
<p> Here are some ways dogs show they love or trust someone, according to veterinarians.
<h> A dog that loves you will likely recognize your name â€” and be visibly excited when they hear it.

<p> It&#x27;s not a surprise that pets can learn their own names, but many dogs will also respond to the names of their owners.
<p> Jamie Richardson, veterinarian and medical chief of staff at Small Door Veterinary, told Insider that dogs often get excited when the names of their favorite people are mentioned.
<p> &quot;Over time, dogs learn to recognize human names. If they hear a loved one&#x27;s name mentioned who isn&#x27;t present, they&#x27;ll get excited at the thought that they might appear,&quot; said Richardson.
<h> Dogs can show trust by bringing you items that need &quot;fixing.&quot;

<p> Michelle L. Szydlowski, veterinary technician and an anthrozoology instructor at Beacon College in Leesburg, Florida, told Insider that some dogs show trust in their owners by presenting them with &quot;broken&quot; objects.
<p> &quot;Some dogs will show their affection for you and faith in your intelligence by bringing you items that need &#x27;fixing,&#x27;&quot; said Szydlowski.
<p> For example, Szydlowski said that a dog may bring its owner a dead animal or broken toy and whine for the owner to &quot;solve the problem.&quot;
<p> &quot;Guarding behavior is often a sign that your dog feels you belong to its pack. A guarding dog might sit next to the table, facing away from you while you eat or stand immediately in front of another dog if you are sitting nearby,&quot; said Szydlowski.
<p> However, Szydlowski warned that most veterinarians would discourage this type of guarding behavior, as it can lead to dogs becoming overly territorial or developing behavioral issues.
<h> Some dogs show affection by herding their owners.
<p> Some dogs are known for their herding tendencies.

<p> Szydlowski told Insider that if your dog tries to keep family members from wandering off on their own, they could be displaying herding behavior.
<p> &quot;Herding is a way of showing affection for the &#x27;pack.&#x27; For example, if someone in the family or another pet steps off the sidewalk, some dogs will herd the wayward member back onto the sidewalk and safety,&quot; said Szydlowski.
<p> &quot;[Pet] dogs can raise their inner eyebrows much more dramatically than wild dogs, and this sympathetic, adorable expression is thought to induce feelings of care and nurturing in their human owners,&quot; said Greenstein.
<h> Sharing toys is another way that dogs express love.
<p> If your dog brings you a tattered toy, it may mean more than you think.

<p> You may have no interest in your dog&#x27;s tattered tennis ball, but their willingness to share it with you is a sign of true affection.
<p> &quot;If your dog really loves you, they will often bring their favorite toy. This is their way of sharing their stuff with you and showing they care,&quot; said Ochoa.
<h> If your dog can tell when you need comfort, it could be a sign they care about you.
<p> &quot;Dogs can innately sense when you are sad or struggling with something. They will find a way to cuddle up to you, rest their head on you, or generally find a way to be close to you during these times,&quot; said Richardson.
<h> Dogs can use cuddling to bond with their owners on a chemical level.

<p> Just like humans, dogs use snuggling to grow closer to others, so if your pet wants to cuddle they are probably feeling the love.
<p> &quot;Gentle touching and nuzzling mimic maternal affection between puppies and their original dog moms. These physical activities induce the release of the feel-good hormone, oxytocin, in both species,&quot; said Greenstein.
