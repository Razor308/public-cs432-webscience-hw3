<h> ‘The time for Liberal lectures on fiscal responsibility is over’: Shadow Treasurer

<p> Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers has accused the Morrison government of “stupendous hypocrisy” following Coalition criticism of a Labor proposal to overhaul childcare in a bid to support women returning to the workforce.
“Building a childcare system that works for families would turbocharge productivity and workplaces, delivering a much-needed boost in economic growth of, conservatively, $4 billion a year,” Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese said.
Asked why any household earning up to $500,000 should receive any government subsidy, Mr Chalmers said the childcare reform wasn’t a welfare measure but was “about making sure more women can participate in work”.
“It’s about making sure that more Australian women can grab the opportunities of the economic recovery when it comes,” he said.
Mr Chalmers also said criticism from the Morrison government regarding where the finances to support such a scheme would come from was “absolutely laughable”.
“This is a government that racked up more than a trillion dollars in debt. They announced 98 billion dollars in new spending on Tuesday spending which wasn’t offset,&quot; he said.
“The time for the government lecturing Labor about fiscal responsibility is well and truly over.
“The time for the government dusting off all of the old scare campaigns about the budget has been once and for all torpedoed.”
