<p> SEATTLE, WA—The Babylon Bee had the honor of sitting down with a local brave #resistance fighter to learn more about the fearless counterculture fighting against hate and other bad stuff like that. According to Doy Keeblesmush, a leader of the local resistance movement in Seattle, the ideology consists of whatever the media, universities, corporations, and Hollywood tell them they should think.
<p> &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;m pretty much a free thinker,&quot; said Keeblesmush when interviewed at a protest rally sponsored by Kinko&#x27;s. &quot;I would say my ideology is an eclectic mix of Vox, Marvel comics, Starbucks&#x27; Twitter feed, and whatever my Sociology 101 professor says. There&#x27;s a lot of hate and misinformation out there, so it&#x27;s important that I get my life&#x27;s moral compass entirely from multi-billion dollar corporations and celebrities. The only exception is dead German philosophers like Marx. They&#x27;re cool too.&quot;
<p> According to Keeblesmush, blindly following the prevailing winds of culture as dictated by trends and hype is the best way of making sure one is on the &quot;right side of history.&quot;
<p> &quot;It&#x27;s important to be on the right side of history since that is literally the only way to determine whether something is right or wrong!&quot; said Keeblesmush. &quot;Now if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I have to attend an afternoon boycott of MyPillow organized by Tempur-Pedic.&quot;
