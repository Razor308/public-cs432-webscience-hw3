<h> Elementary School Kids Taught That “Objectivity” and “Perfectionism” Are Racist Traits of “White Supremacy”
<p> Children at an elementary school in Virginia are being taught that traits such as “objectivity” and “perfectionism” are ‘racist’ characteristics of “white supremacy.”
<p> Yes, really.
<p> Author James Lindsay posted a screenshot of the lesson outline, which is apparently taken from a 2001 Dismantling Racism Workbook by authors Tema Okun and Kenneth Jones and is being taught to kids aged 6-11 at the Belvedere Elementary School in Virginia.
<p> Other respondents pointed out that such teaching is hallmark of Critical Race Theory (CRT), which is still being taught in U.S. schools despite being banned after an executive order by President Trump.
<p> This is what critical race theory teaches in our schools, businesses, and government agencies. @realDonaldTrump was right to cancel it and parents should demand their schools stop teaching it. https://t.co/18qk2n9xV1
<p> Others noted that such characteristics were not solely revered in white societies, and that people from other cultures “would be highly offended by hearing them described as “white supremacy.”
<p> Great example of the provincial, monocultural nature of CRT. I can think of at least half a dozen non-Western cultures where some or all of those 15 traits are valued, and people would be highly offended by hearing them described as &quot;white supremacy.&quot;
<h> Playstation Says it Will Enable Voice Chats to be Recorded So Players Can be Snitched on for Mean Words
<p> Sony has announced that it will allow Playstation users to record in-game voice chats so players can snitch on each other for mean words said during private conversations.
<p> Yes, really.
<p> The game console’s latest update forces users to waive their privacy rights, allowing others to report them and get their accounts banned for speech violations.
<p> “Following this update, users are seeing a notification about Party Safety and that voice chats in parties may be recorded,” Sony announced. “Voice chat recording for moderation is a feature that will be available on PS5 when it launches, and will enable users to record their voice chats on PS5 and submit them for moderation review. The pop up you’re seeing on PS4 right now is to let you know that when you participate in a chat with a PS5 user (post-launch), they may submit those recordings from their PS5 console to SIE.”
<p> Playstation is now recording private party voice chatting for &#x27;violations&#x27;.
<p> If a group of friends want to make off color jokes to each other privately, talk about freaky stuff or sexual content then that&#x27;s their business.
<p> “If a group of friends want to make off color jokes to each other privately, talk about freaky stuff or sexual content then that’s their business,” complained one Twitter user.
<p> Sony claims the update is necessary to enforce “safety and moderation” standards and prevent harassment, yet the actual agenda is obviously to police political speech and prevent criticism of far-left groups like Black Lives Matter.
<p> As Chris Menahan notes, “The move comes just a few months after PlayStation partnered with the Anti-Defamation League — a leftist group which advocates for online censorship and hate speech laws in the name of stopping “the defamation of the Jewish people” — to pressure Mark Zuckerberg to ramp up censorship on Facebook.”
<p> EA Sports also teamed up with the ADL to “enforce social justice in gaming,” another example of how Marxist social engineering is being inserted into every form of entertainment imaginable.
<p> TV is dying. Cinema is dead.New outlet for Marxist propaganda required. And guess what&#x27;s at the top of the list?https://t.co/voT9vPpFaj
<h> Company Offering ‘Portable Pod’ For Travelers Concerned About Catching COVID
<p> A company called ViraShield has developed what it calls a “portable pod solution” that caters for people who have “fear of going out” in the age of coronavirus.
<p> “In a matter of seconds, the ViraShield unfolds to give users a protective, six-sided barrier between them and their seatmates,” states a promo for the contraption on the New York Post shopping website.
<p> “This 360-degree protection helps keep bacteria in droplets at bay, so that the next time someone around you coughs or sneezes, you won’t be directly exposed to the particles.”
<p> The product appears to be some kind of personalized transparent tent for the upper body. The image for it shows a woman sitting on a plane seat surrounded by the pod.
<p> “It even allows you to insert an oxygen mask or cover a tray table when you’re flying,” states the promo, adding that the pod can be adjusted for different protection levels.
<p> Numerous different companies have responded to the COVID pandemic by offering pods, upper body visors, or even dog cone-style contraptions.
<p> Back in August, the Governor of Maine ordered restaurant staff to wear anti-COVID visors upside down in order to direct breath upwards, despite concerns this would trap infectious particles in air conditioning units.
<p> With governments mandating the wearing of face masks left right and centre, and social distancing plastic pods popping up everywhere, it isn’t too much of a jump to image a future where we are all forced to walk around in our own bubbles, literally.https://t.co/6tahBMre4n
