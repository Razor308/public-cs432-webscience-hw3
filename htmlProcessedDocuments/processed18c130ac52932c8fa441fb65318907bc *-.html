<p> U.S.â€”Facing growing frustration from parents over prolonged school closures, the American Federation of Teachers has released a statement promising school will resume just as soon as all the public school teachers are done campaigning for Biden.
<p> &quot;We realized that these prolonged school closures were a perfect opportunity to mobilize our 1.7 million-member union to get out the vote for Joe Biden,&quot; said AFT President Randi Weingarten. &quot;Plus, the Biden campaign didn&#x27;t have to pay them since they are already being paid a full salary with taxpayer dollars. It was a win-win for us!&quot;
<p> According to sources across the country, public educators have been dutifully going door to door to make sure they harvest every Biden vote they can before the November election.
<p> &quot;So if you&#x27;re wondering why the schools still aren&#x27;t open, that&#x27;s why. We promise we&#x27;ll start teaching your dumb kids again as soon as the important work of defeating Donald Trump is completed,&quot; Weingarten said.
