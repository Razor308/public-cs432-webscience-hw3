<p> Two competing protests were scheduled Saturday afternoon at Denver&#x27;s Civic Center Park, where the museum is located. One event, called &quot;BLM-Antifa Soup Drive,&quot; was hosted by the Denver Communists and other groups, according to a Facebook event page. The other, dubbed a &quot;Patriot Muster&quot; rally, called on patriots to &quot;stand up&quot; and &quot;show up&quot; in promotional materials.
<p> Montoya had said it was unclear whether either person, the victim or suspect, was involved in the protests.
