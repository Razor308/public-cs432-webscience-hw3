<p> Hey, Jeff Larson here, executive Director of Bushwick Northwest uh really excited to be here um we&#x27;re looking back over these last 10 years and uh it&#x27;s been 10 years and we&#x27;re performing music inspired by this book 10 years to the day, It&#x27;s gonna be pretty awesome. I&#x27;m really excited and um and uh I just wanted to let you know a little bit about how we got started because uh I was living in New York and I saw the show where performers and audience members were so connected and they&#x27;re connected through books and through music. I thought it was so incredible. That I knew that the musicians in Seattle um we&#x27;re gonna eat it alive cuz I know that the the artist here are just so wonderful. I just love. I love the CR scene and so when I started to move back, I started reaching out to the perform that I know that cares about music that care about performing that cares about the crafting of a song that cares about words and um and and playing for an engaged audience and this, this is the network that I knew and then I ask those people to reach out to Maureen. what really happened was we started creating a community that was built from the community that we are the little community that I had and it&#x27;s just. Is such an incredible incredible lengths where now we&#x27;ve worked with over 400 uh musicians and artists here in Seattle and it&#x27;s just it just feels so good to be part of a community that cares about one another and about performing and about the arts and about engaging with each other in conversation. Um it&#x27;s pretty awesome, you know and um none of this would be none of this would happen without those musicians without people volunteering their time, and you know that&#x27;s how much. Got started and um we&#x27;re continuing to work hard and you know, try to grow and bring more people in to be a part of the community actually for maybe for us to be a part of their community and to show more different kinds of arts and I hope that we get there. um I know that we will we&#x27;re gonna continue to move forward and perform music inspired by books so um enjoy and here we are 10 years later and here&#x27;s another ten They&#x27;re all Jeff Larson here. um I&#x27;m really excited to be here to play a song inspired by uh one of my favorite books here. K slaughterhouse Five, This is the first book that we ever did with Bush book Club and uh whoo. let&#x27;s do it again ready Um we were were asked to we were prompted with the question as to where would we go in the last 10 years if we became unstuck in time for you to leave twenty go some place else where it might go uh kind of an additional prompt for this book and I thought I would take us back 10 years to the day to the first Bush. Book club performance that was ever on the stage that would be me. It&#x27;s true, I was nervous. I don&#x27;t perform that much on stage with the guitar. My voice. I then I&#x27;ve done it a lot now but. Back then it was a big deal so I&#x27;m gonna perform the song that I did the very first bushwick performance ever. It&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a song called round of applause um songs um the song is kind of about Billy Pilgrim becoming unstuck in time. what that means is he can go anywhere. He goes to any point in his life He can go to any point in his life um at any point in his life um uh he when he was he was abducted by aliens in the book, the twelve auditoriums and Kinda opened his eyes to the fact that humans would only see uh time through a little pin prick um and uh we can only see the one point in time at one point, but the armor could see everything at once and he was opened up to this and he could then again he could then move through time um he didn&#x27;t really do it on purpose, but uh he would move through time and see everything all at once it was very, It was a pretty cool uh scenario and a really cool way for the book to be written. we&#x27;d be in. Dim during World War two we&#x27;d be at the uptown with this convention, we&#x27;d be in a car he&#x27;d be hanging out with different people um and we just learned his story through this jumping through time um his favorite place was to be though was um on uh the armor. planet um in a zoo with this woman in Montana wild hack who&#x27;s also a human from earth. Um she&#x27;s an actress and um the trolls love to watch them uh. Interact with one another um yeah, it&#x27;s a good way to say it and um the travels they were funny. They&#x27;re just funny creatures they um were they look like toilet plungers with the sticks sticking up and a hand on top of the eye in the middle and um yeah, there&#x27;s made me laugh and how they would applaud because they actually they actually would communicate through um through their minds, but um they would applaud like this. When they got excited, they would do this and it always made me laugh So um the song is about um Billy jumping around through time and finding his favorite place, which was with Montana back, give us a try. Alright, here we go 10 years later round of applause. Let&#x27;s get this started. Where I wanna be. Keep your heart everyone will. Some people can go. Food here and just hope. Round of applause.

Yeah. And I was inspired by a part, I&#x27;ve read before where um Kurt meets with his buddy and his The wife comes in and says you guys were just babies when you&#x27;re fighting the war and I kinda feel like that now going through the pandemic and feeling like God, I feel like just a young baby going through it figuring out how to figure this out So this is a song called living on Faith.

What would you revisit from the last 10 years? I&#x27;d love to be in almost any moment in the last 10 years when we could still all be together in a big room listening to live music and talking about books, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m going to. But the moment I would revisit is the week leading up to the Seahawks 2014 Super Bowl win. Happy 10 years everybody. Here&#x27;s a little tune about time. It&#x27;s one thing to have one thing one thing to me a little more. It&#x27;s one thing one thing to lose whether it&#x27;s long or it&#x27;s short. It&#x27;s one thing to waste one thing to chase one thing to face long. Thing to set it to take form whatever your standard or something or it&#x27;s money. get by. March on waiting for No one it works in it slips capsules and here I suppose it&#x27;s gone. But it&#x27;s one thing to spend one thing to share one thing to buy and sing. One thing to manage you bargain its passage is one thing to serve it upstate its and its constraints and gaps, and some say we&#x27;ve reached the end. We kill it and then the frame and slide and made it look in the spit or it&#x27;s down and its spring We flirt with them. Waiting to once it&#x27;s mean and it&#x27;s story and on. I suppose till it&#x27;s gone. It&#x27;s a one thing to keep one thing to sleep on one thing to reap its reward. Come a good come back. come a heavier side. In focus It&#x27;s big and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s forces we feed it&#x27;s quality never enough. Minute 5 minute we are stuck in balancing the skill with our love or vomiting and priming and it all it&#x27;s waiting for no one but it&#x27;s to get away day after day I suppose till it&#x27;s gone. Yeah it&#x27;s to get away day after. Hope till it&#x27;s gone. Hi, my name is Melissa Mono and I was one of the original performers at the Bushwick Book Club, Seattle&#x27;s first show ever at the can uh Jeff had asked me to perform and I said, Well, I&#x27;m not really writing songs and he&#x27;s like well. Maybe I&#x27;ll get you writing songs and so I wanna thank you Jeff for that. I&#x27;ve written tons of songs since then made albums with my band funky to death um. I&#x27;m just looking back on the last 10 years, It&#x27;s been a really beautiful journey I&#x27;ve had lots of joy. I&#x27;ve experienced grief I have been bored. I&#x27;ve been really excited about life I heard an album called for the ladies by Al Dente, and I said, who is that I must know him and now he is my life partner and father of our beautiful daughter Gigi. And so here I am 10 years later working with Bushwick as a membership coordinator and sometimes performing so thank you. Bushwick. Thank you Bushwick family. Here&#x27;s to ten more. There&#x27;s no other place you can actually get this kind of enrichment and this kind of experience no other place. The other experiences I&#x27;ve had with concert sin and the arts of way way more expensive. This is very affordable. They really can&#x27;t survive without uh a monthly contribution model of fundraising they cannot survive and I&#x27;m you know after 10 years I. This is a critical move for bushwick to have that sustaining monthly membership that they can count on and know what their budget is all uh non profits have to have that. it&#x27;s crucial $5 $10 2550, You know whatever your your budget can to me. That&#x27;s not very much for what we get in the arts from them. It&#x27;s not very much at all and it&#x27;s so crucial for them to have that I don&#x27;t want the arts to be. In this world as it exist today and monthly membership is the way to go and I&#x27;m so happy to do it and I encourage everybody to join. Hello, my name is Chris Poe and I read Kurt Slaughterhouse Five. What an amazing book I mean I didn&#x27;t read it in high school and so this is my first time reading this and I was really touched the main character&#x27;s name is Billy Pilgrim and it follows his life as a World War. Two veterans follows him through World War two, but he kind of has some. TS and skips around in time a lot in the book skips around in time with Billy and the scene that really um just spoke to me was about halfway through the book or in the middle somewhere he&#x27;s uh his daughter&#x27;s getting married and he goes to his daughter&#x27;s house and it&#x27;s the night before her wedding and he&#x27;s going to just relax on the couch and grabs a bottle of wine turns on the TV and a World War two. Documentary comes on and I have to imagine it must have triggered some things cuz how could it not so instead of watching the movie in forward Billy sees the movie in reverse and it was jaw dropping to read how Kurt expressed award in reverse It was just totally moving so I wanted to share that with you if you think about this for a second where where you take one of the devastating things uh that we&#x27;ve. To humanity and you undo it becomes like a humanitarian effort. So here&#x27;s my sadly ironic song about war in reverse it goes like this. Full of holes and wounded men farmers in rivers have been first comes a plane to save the day. Technicians on board used instruments to suck a bullets right out of the ten they sent those people safely on their way. Planes on the ground flew up to join formations in the sky Tensions seed to the healing. I was well. Getting better all the time people. Any child. As the city below engulfed in flames was burning to the ground, you would not believe what happened after that. They open wide like a miracle in the sky the fire shrunk in the tubes and went back in the hole. These tubes were rocked and organized as they landed on the base, then they shipped them carefully back to the Usa. All those well. All the time people. In any child, It was a beautiful scene in the factories as women work day and night. The bombs to keep the world safe. They separated all the minerals. Them back in the hills. Really clever. In the ground. Pilots turned in their uniforms and my kids they went back to school to unlearn everything they saw all well and get mad at all the time people have. Each other well. And getting better. The Thanks for listening peace.

Thank you Amanda Andy and Theresa from all playing on with the show. Hi, everybody. hope you&#x27;re doing well um so the first thing that struck me about slaughterhouse five was actually the title because I was thinking um if you take away the S from slaughter house, you get laughter house, which really amused me and it&#x27;s just such a. It&#x27;s like a one letter different and so I was like, Oh, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s such a small thing like what uh what a fine line it is and literally the line. Is the letter S Um I&#x27;m kind of on the same thing just the way that Kurt um talks about this really heavy things in the book and it&#x27;s like Oh and then so and so died and so it goes and then just kinda keeps moving on and just also in the theme of this whole year, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s such a fine line between um like sanity and madness and almost everything else just feels like it&#x27;s an extreme and you can go either way. Um so that&#x27;s really what struck me the most about the song. I mean, sorry this book um and if I were to become unstuck from the twenty grind, I probably go back to that year when I was living in Australia, but that was fun and I had no responsibility so I would I would go back there anyway. Hope you like this song and I miss you all so much and I hope to see you soon. Remember that day we jumped right off the cliff against the laws of gravity we call each other in the air and remember that night to the slaughter House of Beg and Beg you not to leave me all alone. Remember that next day that you will laugh and the left alone to pretend I&#x27;ve got the oh so it goes. Fine line between love and the disaster. It&#x27;s a house of prayer. It goes on between the and a laughter and the shape of a letter that something like a sink It&#x27;s a fine line between a light and a death. That&#x27;s a as a being. I remember that night everyone went to bed and everything was normal in a boring kind of way and remember that next day when we woke up was down in black was white and everything was monotone. How we took the small pleasures and made them into my. Dress yourself, Oh, so it&#x27;s a fire on the. The disaster as a threat. Get a fine line between some. Something like a snake. My life. Oh, Remember that time almost fell in love and it was real and I could feel the endless possibilities of hope. And it felt like an open bag of wreaths that spilled on the floor and oh remember when we cry for days until we started laughing everything was right. Oh, so it goes. On Slower than That looks something like this. Like this and it&#x27;s a the give us the violence. And disaster. as a threat on him when it comes. A letter that looks something like this. As a Seven. Oh, so it goes. I would like to revisit like every House party or Potluck I&#x27;ve had where you just in really close proximity with everyone sharing a bunch of food and talking super loudly, You know those were the good old days. Hello everyone Mike here coming at you almost live from my studio in Beacon Hill. Um I&#x27;m super excited to be here tonight. It&#x27;s the big 10 year anniversary show. Oh my god. I can&#x27;t believe it we&#x27;ve been doing this for 10 years. That&#x27;s insane to me. I played at the very first show I did you guys know that I bet you didn&#x27;t. you probably didn&#x27;t know that. but now you do now, you know something new that you didn&#x27;t know just a few minutes ago. That&#x27;s right. I played in the very first show and I was fucking awesome. I&#x27;ve I blew people&#x27;s minds just like I&#x27;m gonna blow people&#x27;s minds tonight with the new song that I wrote. Inspired by Kurt V Slaughter House five, this will be my fortieth song that I&#x27;ve written and performed for the Bushwick book Club. Seattle That&#x27;s a lot of songs and I should know because I counted them all so I&#x27;ve read Kurt against slaughterhouse five on many occasions. It&#x27;s one of my favorite books um and I read it again for the show and I hope you guys read it too. Um if you haven&#x27;t read it yet just go ahead and leave a little. Comment in the message section of the show and um maybe I&#x27;ll come over and read it to you sometime um I&#x27;m okay with that. I don&#x27;t have anything else to do. I don&#x27;t have a job. I&#x27;m not doing shit just sitting around farting around. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m doing um so I&#x27;m more than happy to come over and read the book to you if uh if you want, I found it it interesting Billy Pilgrim isn&#x27;t really a hero. He never saves the day he never rescues. A cat out of a burning building he just sort of walks around and stuff happens to him stuff is just happening to him, and he doesn&#x27;t do shit. He&#x27;s just walking around um and that&#x27;s kinda what my songs songs about just stuff to you cuz that&#x27;s what life&#x27;s about. It&#x27;s a big beautiful weird mess. It doesn&#x27;t make any sense but it it&#x27;s happening nonetheless and there&#x27;s not much you can do about it. uh one last thing uh I want to take this opportunity to read to you my favorite sentence in the entire book. He farted tremendously and then he belted. I put that in my song by the way, so you&#x27;ll have to listen for that um feel free to raise your hand when you hear it and maybe I&#x27;ll come to your house and give you some candy or something. Alright. Well, I guess I guess that&#x27;s my song. It&#x27;s starting a song starting now. I can hear it in the background that&#x27;s weird. uh I guess I need to go now. How I&#x27;m going baby going to the grave? It. And I did I mention the fourth did I mention? Everything is happening forever. One of the travel. Things are flowing out of time. This story I know how it ends, don&#x27;t forget the middle part when tell your friends some stuff happening. And other stuff some dumb. Life as meaning from the Blowing up the universe of searching spaceship. These moments keep flowing. Ladies and gentlemen, Mister Mike on the string electric guitar. Was fantastic. Get the fuck out of here. Okay. See you later. It&#x27;s tremendously while waiting for the dark. Now with drowning. the corner of I&#x27;m out of time. Thank you hamburger night. Hi bushwick.

Happy ten great job and here&#x27;s to another 10 years. Congratulations. Hi. I&#x27;m Annie J. Hi. I&#x27;m Nate B. and together we make bucket of honey. Nate What have you been up to over the last decade? Ringing the That was pretty fun that was really fun. What about that one out? Let it out you know out of the bag absolutely in the past 10 years, I guess we have known each other for more than that now on my memory is like a piece of Swiss cheese. Oh, let&#x27;s just get real talk while we&#x27;re on the record. Well, that&#x27;s all good. I&#x27;m just gonna delete all that shit anyways. so dude. What am I gonna say that&#x27;s the opposite of what I said. I&#x27;m not gonna comment on that. That&#x27;s bullshit. Oh. wow. Yeah. That&#x27;s true. That&#x27;s true. And now I feel like I might have really stifle your creativity by saying no uh II have regrets about that. Oh baby. No we used to play with each other all the time yeah growth and yes. I think you caught some crabs in Alaska didn&#x27;t you. I caught crabs in Alaska. That&#x27;s true so it goes that was pretty fun. That was a blast. Are you kidding? That&#x27;s AI mean that would be a nice time to get the flashback to I wouldn&#x27;t back to that. I flash back to that. No, we didn&#x27;t catch crabs from each other and we didn&#x27;t marry each other. No. both of those things are true statements. I can&#x27;t say we&#x27;re doing pretty well. Yeah. I&#x27;d say we do indeed. I first read slaughter House 5 years ago. uh I mean decades ago as a high school student in Cincinnati, Ohio, it was my first encounter with anything by Kurt finding a junior um I&#x27;ve never read anything like it and I was truly taken by the book when I sat down to write this song, I decided to go down the path of what I thought was the main point of the book, which is quite simply war is a bad thing. Uh I. However, that he didn&#x27;t really say anything about the possibility of humanity ending the idea of war uh that was left open. so what I took away from it is in the scheme of human endeavor. There are good things and there are bad things. There are ugly things. There are beautiful things there&#x27;s war there&#x27;s peace and it will probably always be that way. so when I decided to write this song, I decided to do it from the viewpoint of. Just some poor soul caught up in this thing who&#x27;s along for the ride, Hopefully we&#x27;ll make it through it and so my son in time but first I&#x27;d like to say. Follow myself inside. You never told me before. In time, I will know. Time. The flight Thunder It all. Red Sky Someday I will. That time I have to stay. Inside Hear the birds soft Go. Side. This summer. Fly free Fly free Guns have fallen the same now. Never matters anyhow. Someday. Myself. Inside Told me one for Hidden Time. I will. I&#x27;d like to say, thanks in particular to mister Ben Hunter for such violin plane. Thank you Ben. I&#x27;d also like to thank mister Westwood for such exquisite mandolin, thanks a lot. You folks out there Y&#x27;all stay safe and thanks for listening. Unstuck in time, I&#x27;d like to go back to the party. I&#x27;ve thrown a lot of parties in my time and I wanna go back to that Super crowded party, where everybody is kind of having to turn sideways to get around where where there&#x27;s a yelling and there&#x27;s people drunken poets, reciting poetry and the stereo really loud and there&#x27;s fun music and I&#x27;d like to go back to that party. That&#x27;s if I&#x27;m gonna be unstuck in time, I wanna be in a really crowded party where there&#x27;s one or two party crashers that I don&#x27;t quite know who they are. but.

I was honored to be part of the first group of musicians doing original music inspired by books out here in Seattle and I&#x27;m really glad that you could join us all tonight for the tenth anniversary show. It&#x27;s really exciting to be here 10 years later still doing original music inspired by books. It&#x27;s a bit of a trip and it&#x27;s been really exciting and reward for this tenth anniversary I thought about the power that these books have had that we&#x27;ve done over the past 10 years the power of reading generally and decided to write a tune. That&#x27;s. About the power of books to rescue whatever kind of situation that you&#x27;re in whether it&#x27;s loneliness whether it&#x27;s desperation whether it&#x27;s feeling like you&#x27;re the only person that&#x27;s like you books have an incredible power. I&#x27;ve been rescued by them and I ask some of my friends if they&#x27;ve been rescued by books and you&#x27;ll see some of their thoughts at the end of the video. So thank you so much for tuning in and supporting Bushwick and I hope to see you all again in person sometime soon. Take care. Keep reading Keep listening. The only one wonder why. You lost.
