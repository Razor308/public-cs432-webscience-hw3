<p> The grant from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit means the directive from Abbott, a Republican, will stand until the court has considered the state&#x27;s motion for a stay on its merits.
<p> Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had filed an emergency motion Saturday for a stay pending appeal to block a district court order that would have allowed county officials to accept hand delivery of mail-in ballots at any county annex or satellite office.
<p> The motion seeks to require eligible voters to hand-deliver their ballots to a single early voting clerk&#x27;s office to ensure ballot security, his office said in a release.
<p> &quot;The district court&#x27;s order undermines our election security, disrupts the democratic process, and will only lead to voter confusion. It cannot stand,&quot; Paxton said in the news release. &quot;Mail-in ballots are particularly vulnerable to fraud. Protections that ensure their security must be upheld and my office will continue to fight for safe, free and fair elections.&quot;
