<p> In examining the president’s tax returns, the Times uncovered a $21 million windfall that the president received in 2016 from a Las Vegas hotel that he co-owns with casino mogul Phil Ruffin.

<p> “The bulk of the money went through a company called Trump Las Vegas Sales and Marketing that had little previous income, no clear business purpose and no employees,” the Times writes. “The Trump-Ruffin joint venture wrote it all off as a business expense.”
<p> This transaction, which tax experts told the Times was “highly unusual,” came just as Trump injected $10 million of his own money into his presidential campaign.
<p> While the Times was unable to establish definitively that the cash was used to fund the president’s campaign, it did find that “the cash flowed, in a chain of transactions, to several Trump-controlled companies and then directly to Mr. Trump himself.”
<p> If Trump did use this money for his campaign, that could be a potentially illegal campaign contribution that siphoned off cash from one of the president’s businesses before being fraudulently written off as a business expense.
<p> “Why all of a sudden does this company have more than $20 million in fees that haven’t been there before?” Daniel Shaviro, a professor of taxation at the New York University School of Law, asked the Times when shown documentation of the transaction. “And all of this money is going to a man who just happens to be running for president and might not have a lot of cash on hand?”

<p> White House spokesman Judd Deere lashed out at the Times for its reporting and called it “yet another politically motivated hit piece inaccurately smearing a standard business deal.”
