<p> “For now we’re focused on our newest title, but we’ve left the door open for a return to Ori’s world. It would really come down to whether or not there’s a story that the team is excited to tell.”
<p> “There are a lot of possibilities for stories to tell in [Ori game settings] Niwen or Nibel. As you mentioned, both prequels and spin-offs would give us an opportunity to expand on the lore while giving a fresh perspective.
<p> Although we don’t have anything planned at the moment, I think there’s a lot of potential there. Sometimes I’ll have an idea that I think would be cool to explore, so I make a note of it and file it away for now. Continuing to expand on what we’ve already established could be a lot of fun.”
<p> Gritton also wouldn’t rule out exploring other media for Ori like a comic book or animated show, stating that it “could be really interesting.” He added that “Ori’s world could very easily transfer to other media” and “there’s a lot we could dive into and explore more in-depth” when it comes to lore.
<p> Finally, when asked about the possibility of Ori in Smash Bros., Moon co-founder Gennadiy Korol mentioned:
<p> “I think all of us at Moon would LOVE to see Ori in Smash and we think that Ori’s moveset and fighting mechanics [would] be tons of fun. I honestly think this could be amazing and you should tweet Phil Spencer about it!”
