<h> Why is this important
<p> &quot;The moderator of the debate - Chris Wallace - violated a basic principle of journalism - the objectivity clause - by initiating the following biased exchange between him and the presidential candidates during the presidential debate:
Chris Wallace: (41:33)
You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia group and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland.
President Donald J. Trump: (41:57)
Sure, I’m will to do that.
Chris Wallace: (41:59)
Are you prepared specifically to do it.
President Donald J. Trump: (42:00)
I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right wing.
Chris Wallace: (42:04)
But what are you saying?
President Donald J. Trump: (42:06)
I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.
Chris Wallace: (42:08)
Well, do it, sir.
Vice President Joe Biden: (42:09)
Say it, do it say it.
President Donald J. Trump: (42:10)
What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn.
Chris Wallace: (42:14)
White supremacist and right-wing militia.
President Donald J. Trump: (42:18)
Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing.
Vice President Joe Biden: (42:28)
He’s own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization-
President Donald J. Trump: (42:35)
Oh you got to be kidding me.
Vice President Joe Biden: (42:36)
… not a militia. That’s what his FBI Director said.
President Donald J. Trump: (42:41)
Well, then you know what, he’s wrong.
Chris Wallace: (42:42)
We’re done, sir. Moving onto the next… [crosstalk 00:42:46]
President Donald J. Trump: (42:46)
Antifa is bad.
Vice President Joe Biden: (42:47)
Every body in your administration tells you the true, it’s a bad idea. You have no idea about anything.
President Donald J. Trump: (42:53)
You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group.
Chris Wallace: (42:56)
All right, gentlemen we’re now moving onto the Trump-Biden record.&quot;
