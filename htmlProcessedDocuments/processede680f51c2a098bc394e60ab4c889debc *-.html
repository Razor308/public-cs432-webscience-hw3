<h> Xbox Series X has tactile indicators over the ports
<p> Here&#x27;s a brilliant feature of the Xbox Series X: it has tactile indicators over the ports for the blind and to help with reach-around cabling.
<p> Bryce Johnson, inclusive lead at Microsoft Devices and co-inventor of the superb Xbox Adaptive Controller, took to Twitter to reveal the tidbit.

<p> Kaitlyn Jones, program manager working with the Xbox gaming accessibility team, described it as &quot;a distinct bump &#x27;pattern&#x27; for each port type&quot; (HDMI, USB etc). The idea is to assist with port identification through touch.
