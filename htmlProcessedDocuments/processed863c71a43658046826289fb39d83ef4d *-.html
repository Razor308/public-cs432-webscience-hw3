<p> Montoya said he could not comment on whether a Denver TV station was involved in the shooting when asked during the press conference.
<p> The shooting took place around 3:37 p.m. MT (5:37 p.m. ET) near Civic Center Park as a protest was ending, Montoya said.
<p> A verbal altercation occurred before the shooting and two guns and a can of Mace were recovered at the scene, Montoya said.
<p> Peaceful protesting is encouraged, but demonstrations that escalate to violence and clashes will not be tolerated, Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock said in a statement issued in a series of posts on Twitter following the shooting.
<p> &quot;Political differences should be resolved at the ballot box and not in the streets, and we will keep it that way through this election season and beyond,&quot; Hancock wrote. &quot;And with the pandemic, we encourage people to not gather in large groups, and stay safe at home.&quot;
