<p> Nine in 10 major local authorities in England do not have enough money to cover their spending plans this year, official documents have shown.
<p> Analysis by BBC News has found the coronavirus could see councils this year overspend their budgets by £1.7bn.
<p> The Local Government Association (LGA) warned authorities faced &quot;spiralling demands&quot; on their finances.
<p> The government said councils had received £4.8bn in emergency support since the start of the pandemic.
<p> Since March local authorities across the country have provided emergency pandemic support to some of the most vulnerable people in society.
<p> But the cost of providing this support has left many councils struggling financially.
<h> How many councils are struggling?
<p> BBC News has analysed the most recent financial monitoring documents published by 144 out of 149 unitary and county councils in England.
<p> After taking account of emergency grant funding from central government, the documents revealed nine in every 10 of these councils was forecasting they would overspend their budget this year.
<p> The forecasts were largely calculated on the basis of the authorities&#x27; spending in the first quarter of the 2020-21 financial year.
<p> By law councils are not allowed to spend more money than they have in their day-to-day spending budget nor can they borrow money to fund public services.
<p> The documents show that Hampshire County Council has a net budget gap of more than £80m. Council officers warned the authority needed &quot;at least £52.4m of additional government support&quot; before it could be considered to be &quot;financially sustainable in the medium term&quot;.

<h> Key workers could now face redundancy
<p> Amanda Burley leads a team of Leeds City Council support workers helping people to recover from covid-19. Ms Burley said her team&#x27;s work was vulnerable to future budget cuts being considered by the council.
<p> &quot;I watched my partner lose his job at the beginning of lockdown, which put huge financial and emotional stress on us,&quot; she said.
<p> &quot;It&#x27;s a scary place to be, fearing for your livelihood. I love my job but there&#x27;s a great amount of fear, because we don&#x27;t know what the budget cuts are going to be in March 2021.&quot;
<p> The council said it was working to avoid making any employees compulsorily redundant.

<p> Leeds council&#x27;s deputy leader James Lewis said the authority had requested an emergency £50m loan from the government.
<p> He said if ministers did not provide the loan, and the council could not pass an emergency budget, then the authority would have to issue a Section 114 notice in November, a technical form of bankruptcy for public authorities in England.
<p> &quot;Securing the immediate and long-term sustainability of local services must now be the top priority for the (government&#x27;s) spending review&quot; said Councillor Richard Watts, from the Local Government Association.
<p> &quot;This includes the government meeting in full the financial challenges councils face as a result of Covid-19 - including all lost income - and providing long-term investment to allow councils to plug funding gaps, meet demand pressures and improve local services for communities.&quot;
<h> How could a council balance its books by March?
<p> There would be three main options.
<p> Councils could stop providing or cut funding for discretionary services such as art galleries and leisure centres. This could result in job losses and a loss of some services.
<p> But local authorities would not be allowed to completely stop providing key services such as bin collections or basic social care.
<p> Councils could look to use money they held in reserve, a kind of savings account, to top up their current spending budgets.
<p> Nottingham City Council said it was planning to use half of its cash reserves to deal with its current financial pressures. Last year the authority held £140m in reserve but it expects to use £70m this year to address its budget shortfall.
<p> A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said the government had provided a package of measures worth £28bn to help local communities through the coronavirus pandemic.
<p> &quot;We will continue to work closely with councils as they support their communities through the pandemic and if any are concerned about their future financial position, they should contact MHCLG,&quot; the spokeswoman added.
