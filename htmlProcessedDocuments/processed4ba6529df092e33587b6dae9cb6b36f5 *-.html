<p> She added, &quot;don&#x27;t believe a word that comes out of this witche&#x27;s mouth.. and yes she gives witches a bad name.&quot;
<p> Alley was likely referring to the announcement by Pelosi that she was introducing legislation to convene a panel of experts to determine if the president was incapacitated and should be removed according to the dictates of the 25th Amendment.
<p> The Baker Act is a Florida law that allows mentally ill people to be held involuntarily at a mental health facility.
<p> On Friday, Pelosi insisted that the commission was not intended primarily to remove Trump from office.
<p> &quot;He will face the judgment of the voters. But he shows the need for us to create a process for future presidents,&quot; she said. &quot;This legislation applies to future presidents, but we are reminded of the necessity of action by the health of the current president.&quot;
<h> &#x27;You hate him. Just report that&#x27;
<p> Alley has been a vocal critic of the media and those on the left. In the latest episode on Monday, she blasted a CNN reporter who she thought was masking her criticism of the president under the guise of disinterested journalism.
<p> &quot;What would you like him to do? Start crying like a little b***h so you can report that he&#x27;s ...crying like a little b***h? He could have a hazmat suit on and you would report ... he&#x27;s a f***ing lunatic in a hazmat suit,&quot; Alley said in her tweet.
<p> &quot;You hate him. Just report that,&quot; Alley added, and excoriated the Democrats in a separate tweet.
<p> &quot;The truth is DEMS have accomplished NOTHING in the last 3 1/2 years other than Devising ways to take TRUMP DOWN,&quot; she said. &quot;U have been a waste of our tax dollars TIME &amp; faith. EVEN with all YOUR attempts to destroy him, you FAILED!&quot;
