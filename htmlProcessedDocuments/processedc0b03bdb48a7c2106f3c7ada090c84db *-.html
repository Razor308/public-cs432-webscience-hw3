<p> After an extensive set of collaborations earlier in the year, Pharrell’s BBC Ice Cream is reuniting with Reebok to close out 2020 with their own take on the Question Low. Following up the Answer V, the pair effectively channels Allen Iverson yet again with a filter of bold, pastel heavy design.
<p> Revealed via eBay, the unreleased offering was listed in near full, highlighting the upper’s multicolor design and its many collaborative details. BBC’s running dog is featured in loud tones across the mid-panel, dressed in blue and yellow against the grain of purple suede. Matching accents, however, do dress adjacent, the yellow adhering to the tongue and much of the collar while the cool tone accents more subtly along the bottom edge. White soles then finish the exterior, “IVERSON” type is given the Ice Cream treatment, soles are finished all-over with further insignia, and the box matches if not exceeds all the aforementioned energy.
<p> Grab a quick look at these right here, and while they’re available to purchase on eBay for a high price tag, it’s possible we’ll see a wider release on Reebok.com.
