<p> Previous commitments to change the behaviour of the police have not had an effect, critics say.
<p> In a series of tweets, the president said that his government&#x27;s &quot;determination to reform the police should never be in doubt&quot;.
<p> I met again with the IGP tonight. Our determination to reform the police should never be in doubt. I am being briefed regularly on the reform efforts ongoing to end police brutality and unethical conduct, and ensure that the Police are fully accountable to the people. pic.twitter.com/yoLoZt7Et9
<p> He added that he was being &quot;briefed... on the reform efforts ongoing to end police brutality and unethical conduct&quot;.
<p> But he called for calm and emphasised that most police officers were committed to protecting Nigerians.
<p> On Friday, in the capital, Abuja, police fired tear gas at protesters who were highlighting police harassment and brutality.

<p> A police spokesman said minimum force had been used but demonstrators told the BBC that some people had been beaten and one said she had heard gunshots.
<p> The hashtag #EndSARS was trending worldwide on Twitter on Friday with celebrities including the Nigerian superstars Wizkid and Davido tweeting their support for protesters.
<p> British-Nigerian Star Wars actor John Boyega has also expressed his backing on social media.
<h> &#x27;Targeted for being flashy&#x27;
<p> The #EndSARS hashtag was first thought to have been used in 2018, but it emerged once again a week ago following the alleged killing of a young man by officers from the Sars unit.
<p> Many people were using the opportunity to share stories of brutality attributed to the police unit, which has developed notoriety for unduly profiling young people, reports the BBC&#x27;s Nduka Orjinmo from Abuja.
<p> Those considered &quot;flashy&quot; often attract the Sars officers&#x27; attention and very few walk away without having to hand over money, while others are arrested or jailed on trumped-up charges and some have been killed, our correspondent adds.

<p> On Sunday, Nigeria&#x27;s inspector general of police Mohammed Adamu banned the Sars unit from carrying out stop and search duties and setting up roadblocks.
<p> He also said members of Sars must always wear uniforms and promised the unit would be investigated.
<p> But protesters want the unit disbanded completely.
<h> Past promises
<p> Two years ago, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo tweeted that he had directed that the &quot;management and activities of Sars&quot; should be overhauled &quot;with immediate effect&quot;.

<p> Then last year, a specially formed Presidential Panel on the Reform of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad recommended reforms along with the dismissal and prosecution of named officers accused of abusing Nigerians.
<p> At the time, President Buhari gave the head of police three months to work out how to implement the recommendations, but critics say little appears to have changed.
