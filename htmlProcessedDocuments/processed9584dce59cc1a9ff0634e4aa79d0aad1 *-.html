<p> Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump has been cleared to return to an active schedule, according to a new memo from his physician, Dr. Sean Conley, released Saturday night.
<p> The memo says Trump has met criteria from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to end isolation but does not say Trump has received a negative coronavirus test since first testing positive for the virus last week. However, that is not a criteria for clearing isolation, according to the CDC.
<p> &quot;This evening I am happy to report that in addition to the President meeting CDC criteria for the safe discontinuation of isolation, this morning&#x27;s COVID PCR sample demonstrates, by currently recognized standards, he is no longer considered a transmission risk to others,&quot; the memo from Conley reads in part.
<p> Conley wrote that Trump is 10 days from the onset of symptoms, has been fever-free for &quot;well over 24 hours&quot; and after diagnostic tests, &quot;there is no longer evidence of actively replicating virus.&quot;
<p> The President&#x27;s doctor said Trump had undetectable &quot;subgenomic mRNA.&quot; Those are molecules produced when viruses replicate. Their absence may suggest Trump is no longer shedding live virus.

<p> But Conley did not fully explain what &quot;advanced diagnostic tests&quot; the President received. For example, he did not disclose whether so-called viral culture was performed. That&#x27;s the process by which scientists try to infect living cells to see whether active virus is present.
<p> According to CDC guidance, research has shown that PCR tests can still pick up pieces of genetic material from the virus long after someone has recovered. But these people aren&#x27;t likely to be infectious 10-20 days after symptoms began. Even though PCR tests can come back positive, patients don&#x27;t tend to be infectious after that 10-20 day window has passed, research has found.
<p> The latest disclosure from Conley comes as Trump prepares to return to the campaign trail after being sidelined amid his fight with the virus. It&#x27;s likely to raise additional questions about the health of the President as officials continue to provide carefully worded statements as the campaign enters its final stretch.
<p> Trump on Saturday held his first public event since his diagnosis, delivering a highly political speech to a crowd of supporters packed on the White House&#x27;s South Lawn. He is currently scheduled to hold at least three in-person rallies this upcoming week, beginning Monday in Florida. Conley says he will continue to monitor Trump &quot;as he returns to an active schedule.&quot;
<p> Officials -- including Conley -- still haven&#x27;t disclosed when the President last tested negative before his positive test last week, which would offer insight into when he was contagious and how much so.
<p> Trump, who left the hospital earlier this week after receiving treatment for the virus, credited his quick recovery to his rapid treatment during an interview with Fox News on Friday.
<p> &quot;I think the secret for me was I got there very early,&quot; he told the network&#x27;s medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel.
<p> Trump had received an immediate dose of an experimental monoclonal antibody therapy at the White House, then was treated with a course of the infused antiviral medication remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone during his hospital stay. He had also been given supplemental oxygen, Conley previously said.
