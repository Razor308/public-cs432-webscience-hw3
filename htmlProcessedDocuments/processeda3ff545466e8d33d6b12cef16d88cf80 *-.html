<h> Your next Apple order could arrive within a day, thanks to a change in the delivery model
<p> Apple has started using some of its retail stores to ship products to consumers, claims Bloomberg.
<p> Usually, devices such as iPhones, iPads, Macs, and accessories are shipped from warehouses or directly from China, where most of Cupertino giant&#x27;s products are manufactured.
<p> To expedite delivery and improve profit margins, the company will now apparently use some retail stores in the US and Canada as distribution centers.
<p> In the US, in-stock items will be shipped through FedEx Corp. United Parcel Service Inc. will be used for deliveries in Canada.
<p> Apple began piloting the program with a small number of outlets after stores began re-opening in June following pandemic related closures. The program has been expanded to more locations since then, but it doesn&#x27;t cover the entire network of nearly 300 stores across the US and Canada at the moment.
<p> The new approach will improve delivery times for customers who live closer to a store than a warehouse. The program will reportedly apply to people who reside within 100 miles from a store.
<p> As a result, some customers may get items as soon as a day after order placement. Currently, Apple takes two to three business days on average to ship products.
<p> The company will internally decide whether to send a product via a distribution center or a store, and consumers won&#x27;t have a say in the decision.
<p> The new model will also help Apple put retail outlets to good use when lockdown-like restrictions impact their operations.
