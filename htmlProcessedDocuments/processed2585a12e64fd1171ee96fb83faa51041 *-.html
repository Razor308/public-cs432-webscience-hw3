<p> A witness told AFP news agency it burst into flames after landing on the house&#x27;s electricity meter.
<p> The larger plane, a Diamond DA40, landed more than a 100m (328ft) away in an uninhabited area. It had three tourists on board.
<p> &quot;All five people involved died,&quot; local government official Nadia Seghier told AFP.
<p> &quot;Air emergency staff from Lyon were brought in at first to track down the plane, which was quickly found.&quot;
<p> There were no immediate details about the identities of the victims or the cause of the collision.

<p> Witness Genevieve Allouard-Liebert, who lives in the area, said she had heard a &quot;big crash&quot; when the planes came down. She said she and her husband saw a man fall from the larger plane as it skimmed nearby rooftops.
<p> Mid-air collisions between small aircraft are considered to be rare. One fatal incident in France happened over Quiberon Bay off the coast of Brittany in 1998, when a Beechcraft 1900D collided in mid-air with a light aircraft, killing 15 people.
<p> &quot;There&#x27;s never any air traffic around Loches, it&#x27;s an unlikely and unbelievable accident,&quot; the town&#x27;s mayor Marc Angenault said.
