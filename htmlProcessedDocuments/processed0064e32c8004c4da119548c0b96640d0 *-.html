<h> Carrollton mayoral candidate accused of mail ballot fraud
<p> Zul Mirza Mohamed is charged with 84 counts of mail ballot application fraud and 25 counts of unlawful possession of an official mail ballot.
<p> CARROLLTON, Texas - A man who hopes to be the next mayor of Carrollton was arrested Wednesday for allegedly requesting and opening dozens of fraudulent absentee mail ballots.
<p> Zul Mirza Mohamed, who is a candidate for mayor in Carrollton, is charged with 84 counts of mail ballot application fraud and 25 counts of unlawful possession of an official mail ballot.
<p> Mohamed has been unsuccessful at getting elected to public office. A few years ago, he ran for mayor and only had 2% of the votes.
<p> Now, instead of looking at a seat inside city hall, Mohamed is sitting in jail on ballot fraud charges.
<p> According to the Denton County Sheriff’s Office, investigators began working in September to identify the person who requested that numerous absentee ballots be sent to a post office box in Lewisville.

<p> The box allegedly belonged to a nursing home, but investigators quickly determined it was rented by someone using a fake driver’s license and student ID.
<p> “You know, nursing homes wouldn’t have a post office box to receive letters and packages for their residents,” said Denton County Sheriff Tracy Murphree.
<p> Investigators also talked to the Carrollton residents who had supposedly requested that the absentee ballots be sent to that post office box. They all said they had not requested a ballot, the sheriff’s office said in a news release.
<p> Undercover officers began working at the post office and spotted the suspect on Wednesday picking up the requested ballots. They followed him to a home on Bennington Drive in Carrollton.
<p> Investigators got a warrant to search Mohamed’s home and allegedly found the ballots open in a bedroom. They also found the fake ID used to rent the post office box, the sheriff&#x27;s office said.
<p> Mohamed is running for mayor against incumbent Kevin Falconer, who is heavily favored to win. Carrollton is partially in Denton County, as well as Dallas and Collin counties.
<p> If convicted, Mohamed faces up to 20 years in prison and fines for the felony offenses.
<p> The city of Carrollton says if Mohamed wins and is convicted, state law would vacate that seat.
