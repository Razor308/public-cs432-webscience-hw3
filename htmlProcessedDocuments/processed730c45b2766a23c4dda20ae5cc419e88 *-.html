<h> How many people are getting it?
<p> It showed 87% had at least one symptom nearly two months later and more than half still had fatigue.
<p> However, such studies focus only on the minority of people who end up needing hospital treatment.
<p> The Covid Symptom Tracker App - used by around four million people in the UK - found 12% of people still had symptoms after 30 days. Its latest, unpublished data, suggests as many as one in 50 (2%) of all people infected have long-Covid symptoms after 90 days.
<h> Do you need severe Covid to get long Covid?
<p> It appears not.
<p> Half of people in a study in Dublin still had fatigue 10 weeks after being infected with coronavirus. A third were physically unable to return to work.
<p> Crucially, doctors found no link between the severity of the infection and fatigue.
<p> However, extreme exhaustion is only one symptom of long Covid.
<p> Prof Chris Brightling, from the University of Leicester and the chief investigator in the PHOSP-Covid project which is tracking people&#x27;s recovery, believes people who developed pneumonia may have more problems because of damage to the lungs.
<h> How is the virus causing long Covid?
<p> There are lots of ideas, but no definitive answers.
<p> The virus may have been cleared from most of the body, but continues to linger in some small pockets.
<p> &quot;If there&#x27;s long-term diarrhoea then you find the virus in the gut, if there&#x27;s loss of smell it is in the nerves - so that could be what&#x27;s causing the problem,&quot; says Prof Tim Spector, from King&#x27;s College London.
<p> The coronavirus can directly infect a wide variety of cells in the body and trigger an overactive immune response which also causes damage throughout the body.
<p> The infection may also alter how people&#x27;s organs function. This is most obvious with the lungs if they become scarred - long-term problems have been seen after infection with Sars or Mers, which are both types of coronavirus.
<p> There are early signs of changes to brain structure, but these are still being investigated. And Covid-19 also does strange things to the blood, including abnormal clotting, and damaging the network of tubes that carry blood around the body.
<p> Prof Strain told the BBC: &quot;The theory I&#x27;m working on is a premature ageing of the small blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to the tissues.&quot; But he warned that until we figure out what is causing long Covid &quot;it is difficult to figure out treatments.&quot;
<h> Is this unusual?
<p> Post-viral fatigue or a post-viral cough are well documented and common - we&#x27;ve probably all had an infection that has taken ages to fully recover from.
<p> Around one in 10 people with glandular fever has fatigue which lasts for months. And there have even been suggestions that flu, particularly after the 1918 pandemic, may be linked to Parkinson&#x27;s-like symptoms.
<p> &quot;With Covid there seem to be more far-reaching symptoms and the number of people seems to be much greater,&quot; says Prof Brightling.
<p> The emphasis though is on the word &quot;seems&quot; as until we have a true picture of how many people have been infected we won&#x27;t know exactly how common these symptoms are, he says.
<p> He told the BBC: &quot;The uniqueness of the way the virus attacks the host and the different ways it then alters the way cells behave seem to be both giving people more severe infection than other viruses and persistent symptoms.&quot;
