<h> US employee &#x27;outsourced job to China&#x27;
<p> A security check on a US company has reportedly revealed one of its staff was outsourcing his work to China.
<p> The software developer, in his 40s, is thought to have spent his workdays surfing the web, watching cat videos on YouTube and browsing Reddit and eBay.
<p> He reportedly paid just a fifth of his six-figure salary to a company based in Shenyang to do his job.
<p> Operator Verizon says the scam came to light after the US firm asked it for an audit, suspecting a security breach.
<p> According to Andrew Valentine, of Verizon, the infrastructure company requested the operator&#x27;s risk team last year to investigate some anomalous activity on its virtual private network (VPN) logs.
<p> &quot;This organisation had been slowly moving toward a more telecommuting oriented workforce, and they had therefore started to allow their developers to work from home on certain days. In order to accomplish this, they&#x27;d set up a fairly standard VPN concentrator approximately two years prior to our receiving their call,&quot; he was quoted as saying on an internet security website.
<p> The company had discovered the existence of an open and active VPN connection from Shenyang to the employee&#x27;s workstation that went back months, Mr Valentine said.
<p> And it had then called on Verizon to look into what it had suspected had been malware used to route confidential information from the company to China.
<p> &quot;Central to the investigation was the employee himself, the person whose credentials had been used to initiate and maintain a VPN connection from China,&quot; said Mr Valentine.
<p> Further investigation of the employee&#x27;s computer had revealed hundreds of PDF documents of invoices from the Shenyang contractor, he added.
<p> The employee, an &quot;inoffensive and quiet&quot; but talented man versed in several programming languages, &quot;spent less than one fifth of his six-figure salary for a Chinese firm to do his job for him&quot;, Mr Valentine said.
<p> &quot;Authentication was no problem. He physically FedExed his RSA [security] token to China so that the third-party contractor could log-in under his credentials during the workday. It would appear that he was working an average nine-to-five work day,&quot; he added.
<p> &quot;Evidence even suggested he had the same scam going across multiple companies in the area. All told, it looked like he earned several hundred thousand dollars a year, and only had to pay the Chinese consulting firm about $50,000 (Â£31,270) annually.&quot;
