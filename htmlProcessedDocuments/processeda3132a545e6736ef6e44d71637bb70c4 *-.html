<h> 21 Underrated Shows That &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot; Fans Will Love Just As Much As They Love Moira Rose
<h> 1.Kim&#x27;s Convenience
<p> CBC
<p> Kim&#x27;s Convenience revolves around the Kims, a Korean-Canadian family who run a convenience store in Toronto. This series is heartfelt, hilariously funny, and just a pure delight. It does an incredible job at creating characters who are funny but still flawed, much like your own loved ones, so you can&#x27;t help but fall in love with them. Similarly to Schitt&#x27;s Creek, Kim&#x27;s Convenience is a hysterical, laugh-inducing sitcom while remaining emotionally grounded. You won&#x27;t find a show with more heart and soul than this one, I promise.
<h> 2.One Day at a Time
<p> Netflix / Pop
<p> One Day at a Time is truly one of the best shows on television. If the live studio audience is any indication, I promise you&#x27;ll be laughing. The series follows the Alvarez family through their daily ups and downs. While this show can be both lighthearted and silly, it also has the range to tackle serious topics like mental illness, immigration, racism, and LGBTQ issues. Like Schitt&#x27;s Creek, One Day at a Time shows viewers just how important family is and makes you wish you were a part of the Alvarez family too.
<p> Where to watch: Seasons 1–3 are on Netflix and Season 4 is currently on Pop and CBS
<h> 3.The Duchess
<p> Netflix
<p> Created by Katherine Ryan, The Duchess follows the story of a *very* fashionable single mother named Katherine who debates having a second child with her former boy bander ex. Season 1 is short and sweet...like, you can pretty much start and finish it in an afternoon. Similar to Schitt&#x27;s Creek, this show is loaded with iconic outfits, good jokes, and characters you can&#x27;t help but adore. Plus, Katherine also gives off MAJOR Alexis Rose vibes.
<h> 4.Workin&#x27; Moms
<p> Netflix
<p> Workin&#x27; Moms follows a group of — you guessed it — working moms as they navigate the everyday struggles of balancing motherhood, their careers, and their personal lives. It&#x27;s — and I cannot stress this enough — one of the funniest shows I&#x27;ve had the privilege of watching. This series is full of strong female characters who are refreshingly real. Moira and Alexis Rose would approve.
<h> 5.Champions
<p> NBC
<p> I think we can all agree that every show Mindy Kaling touches turns to gold, and Champions is no exception. The series follows Vince, a bro-y gym owner trying to live his best bachelor life, until his high school girlfriend Priya drops off their 15-year-old to live with him. Similar to Schitt&#x27;s Creek, it&#x27;s a classic &quot;main character&#x27;s ordinary life is turned upside down&quot; trope, but it works just as well here, and it&#x27;s 100% worth watching. Plus, it&#x27;s only one season, so you&#x27;ll breeze through it.
<h> 6.Great News
<p> NBC
<p> Great News is truly one of television&#x27;s most underrated gifts. The series follows Katie, an up-and-coming news producer who&#x27;s suddenly having a hard time dealing with the new intern — who just happens to be her mother. Let me be the first to tell you that this show is so genuine and sweet. Like Schitt&#x27;s Creek, this series puts a huuuuuge emphasis on the importance of love and family, especially if you have some ~kooky~ family members. Tina Fey is also an executive producer, so you just know it&#x27;s gonna be good.
<h> 7.You&#x27;re the Worst
<p> FX
<p> This series follows Jimmy and Gretchen, who are both extremely reckless and cynical, as they navigate the ups and downs of an adult relationship. While tackling stories about mental health and relationship ethics, You&#x27;re the Worst never fails to stay true to its comedic roots. The characters are low-key ~the worst~, but the more you watch, the more you can&#x27;t help but love them. The show&#x27;s writing is strong and sharp, and it makes you wish you could binge-watch the entire thing in a day.
<h> 8.Grace and Frankie
<p> Netflix
<p> If you fell in love with the Rose family&#x27;s total dysfunctionality, then you will just adore Grace and Frankie. The series follows two women as they figure out how to move on with their lives after learning that both their husbands were having an affair...with each other. Not to be dramatic, but there is absolutely nothing you can possibly hate about this show. It&#x27;s whimsically entertaining in the best way possible. This show also explores just how important friendship and found families are.
<h> 9.Letterkenny
<p> Hulu
<p> Like Schitt&#x27;s Creek, Letterkenny takes place in a very tiny, rural town where pretty much everyone knows each other. The show follows the typical day-to-day problems that arise in Wayne and Katy&#x27;s lives. This show has very low stakes and is purely meant to make you grin and laugh like a fool. You don&#x27;t have to worry about any intense drama or hard to follow plots, because this show is a perfectly perfect sitcom. The characters are amusing and the comedy is gold — what else could you even want in a show?
<h> 10.Crazy Ex-Girlfriend
<p> The CW
<p> Crazy Ex-Girlfriend follows Rebecca Bunch, a woman who drops everything and moves to West Covina, CA after running into a guy she dated at summer camp. This show will always keep you on your toes. It&#x27;s wacky and fun, but also has a lot of heart, and TBH, it might make you cry. Watching this show is like riding a roller coaster of emotion — in the BEST way possible. If you like strong female characters who actually behave like real people, this show will be perfect for you. Oh, and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is loaded with a bunch of jammin&#x27; original songs too.
<h> 11.Black-ish
<p> ABC
<p> Lemme just say that the Johnsons are just as iconic as the Roses. This series follows the Johnson family as they deal with their regular everyday problems, while sometimes emphasizing major sociopolitical issues. Black-ish does a great job of making you actually think about the world outside of the show you&#x27;re watching. The entire cast is phenomenal, and the show is so good you won&#x27;t ever be able to watch ~just one episode~ at a time. Black-ish is a necessary watch for every living, breathing human being.
<h> 12.Superstore
<p> NBC
<p> Schitt&#x27;s Creek is pretty chaotic good, and so is Superstore. The series follows the employees of a local Cloud 9 store and their daily struggles. I&#x27;m not gonna lie, if you&#x27;re any kind of comedy fan, you need to watch this show right now. Superstore has a superb ensemble cast that literally nails every. single. joke. Every character is so well-crafted that after just a few episodes, you&#x27;ll feel like you know each and every one of them. Just do yourself a favor and watch.
<h> 13.Upload
<p> Amazon Prime
<p> Schitt&#x27;s Creek is known for its high-spirited nature, and Upload is full of lighthearted humor too. The series revolves around Nathan, a man who dies an untimely death but chooses to have his consciousness uploaded into a virtual afterlife. Now, I know this premise sounds a little bit daunting, but the show&#x27;s writing makes it so much more digestible and wildly entertaining. I can confidently say that Upload is one of my favorite comedies of 2020.
<h> 14.The Other Two
<p> Comedy Central
<p> The Other Two follows siblings Cary and Brooke Dubek as they adapt to their new lives after their little brother becomes an internet sensation. Cary and Brooke have a sibling relationship that&#x27;s almost identical to Alexis and David&#x27;s. It&#x27;s *chef&#x27;s kiss*. The Other Two is one of the funniest new comedies to hit television. So, basically, if you ever have the privilege to watch this show, you should.
<p> Where to watch: Right now, it&#x27;s available to rent/buy on Amazon or YouTube, but the whole season will be on HBO Max in 2021.
<h> 15.Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt
<p> Netflix
<p> This series follows Kimmy Schmidt, a woman who&#x27;s adjusting to her new life after being rescued from a doomsday cult. What originally started as Kimmy&#x27;s solo survival story becomes a well-rounded ensemble story featuring phenomenal performances from Tituss Burgess, Carol Kane, and Jane Krakowski. Tina Fey created the series and you can definitely tell. This show is basically great joke after great joke. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt has so much goodness, and ironically, it&#x27;s the perfect show to escape to.
<h> 16.Arrested Development
<p> Netflix
<p> Nobody knows dysfunctional family antics more than the Bluths. Arrested Development is a comedy you&#x27;ll fall in love with as soon as you turn it on. The characters are all so well crafted that the show&#x27;s absurdity seems so normal. Like Schitt&#x27;s Creek, this show features a formerly wealthy family who does not adapt very well to their new financial situation. This show thrives on awkward situations and cringey moments, and a star-studded ensemble cast that will never fail to make you chuckle.
<h> 17.I&#x27;m Sorry
<p> TruTV
<p> I&#x27;m Sorry is a super casual, lighthearted comedy about a mother and TV writer named Andrea who&#x27;s just trying to get by and live her greatest life. Andrea Savage created and stars in the series, and she is just a gift in this role. This show is laugh-until-your-sides-hurt funny, and I do not use that phrase lightly! Every single aspect of this show is enjoyable and you&#x27;ll wonder why you never watched it sooner.
<h> 18.Fresh Off the Boat
<p> ABC
<p> If family antics is your vibe, then you need some Fresh Off the Boat in your life. The series follows the Huang family after they relocate from Chinatown in Washington, DC to Orlando. It also takes place in the late &#x27;90s, so there&#x27;s a bunch of nostalgia too. Fresh Off the Boat does a fantastic job at handling more serious topics like immigration and racism, while staying true to the show&#x27;s comedic roots. It&#x27;s a perfect series for anyone who wants to laugh out loud, while also learning and understanding some Asian Americans&#x27; experiences in the US. Like Schitt&#x27;s Creek, you&#x27;ll fall in love with these characters and ultimately always want the best for them.
<h> 19.Santa Clarita Diet
<p> Netflix
<p> Santa Clarita Diet is just so absurdly delightful, I&#x27;d be shocked if you didn&#x27;t binge-watch it in one weekend. Drew Barrymore plays Sheila Hammond, a California real estate agent who suddenly transforms into a zombie. Throughout the series, she and her husband try to figure out how to fool their neighbors into thinking Sheila&#x27;s alive, how to satisfy her cravings for ✨human flesh✨, and get to the bottom of this whole &quot;undead&quot; mystery. Santa Clarita Diet is such a delightful show that&#x27;ll make you love zombies the way you&#x27;ve never loved them before.
<h> 20.Alone Together
<p> Freeform
<p> If you were in love with Alexis and David&#x27;s whole vibe, then you&#x27;ll love Alone Together. This show follows Benji and Maya, two millennials who are just trying to live their best lives and &quot;navigate a world of perfect 10s, as self-proclaimed 6s.&quot; These two have such a great, solid friendship that makes you wish for your own millennial BFF. They always have each other&#x27;s backs, but aren&#x27;t afraid to call each other out for their total absurdities. Alone Together isn&#x27;t just the buddy comedy you want, it&#x27;s the buddy comedy you need.
<h> 21.Finally, Second City Television (SCTV)

<p> Imagine &#x27;80s Saturday Night Live–style sketches, but Canadian. Second City Television, later known as SCTV, is a joyfully wonderful mishmash of everything good. Way before they were Johnny and Moira, Eugene Levy and Catherine O&#x27;Hara starred on this show as a plethora of iconic characters. Just watch it. You&#x27;ll laugh your ass off.
<p> Where to watch: Okay, so this one isn&#x27;t officially streaming anywhere, but it&#x27;s 10,000% worth it to find some clips on YouTube just to see Eugene Levy and Catherine O&#x27;Hara being hilarious.
