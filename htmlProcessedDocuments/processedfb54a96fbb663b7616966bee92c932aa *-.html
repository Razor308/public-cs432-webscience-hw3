<p> There have been total of fifty-three first ladies including forty-two official and eleven acting, within forty-five first ladyships. This discrepancy exists because some presidents had multiple first ladies. Following Donald Trump&#x27;s inauguration on January 20, 2017, his third wife, Melania Trump, became the 42nd official first lady, succeeding Michelle Obama, wife of former president Barack Obama.
<p> In 2007, the United States Mint began releasing a set of half-ounce $10 gold coins under the First Spouse Program with engravings of portraits of the first ladies on the obverse.[11] When a president served without a spouse, a gold coin was issued that bears an obverse image emblematic of Liberty as depicted on a circulating coin of that era and a reverse image emblematic of themes of that president&#x27;s life. This is true for the coins for Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, and James Buchanan&#x27;s first ladies, but not the coin for Chester A. Arthur&#x27;s first lady, which instead depicts suffragetteAlice Paul.[12]
