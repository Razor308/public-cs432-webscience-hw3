<h> Apple Files ‘iPhone for Life’ Trademark Along With iPhone Upgrade Program
<p> Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 12 on October 13 as it sends out invites for its &#x27;Hi, Speed&#x27; event. We are also looking forward to more products like AirTags, new Macs with Apple Silicone, and much more. We are now hearing that the company has filed a new trademark application for the phrase &#x27;iPhone for Life&#x27; alongside a new iPhone Upgrade Program. Let&#x27;s dive in to see some more details on the subject.
<h> Apple Filed a Trademark for the Phrase &#x27;iPhone for Life&#x27; in Hong Kong
<p> Discovered by Patently Apple, the phrase &#x27;iPhone for Life&#x27; trademark has been filed in Hong Kong. The phrase has been used by foreign carriers and retailers as an alternative for iPhone Upgrade Program. As for Apple, the company has never used the phrase before to advertise any program or plan. Hence, this raises a lot of questions about what the new iPhone trademark could have in store for users.
<p> The iPhone trademark application was filed back in September by a legal representative hired by Apple in Hong Kong. It&#x27;s not clear if Apple is beginning a new program or rebranding an existing one. It is also possible that Apple is protecting a phrase used by its resellers. Also, what importance does it hold considering the iPhone 12 is right around the corner?
<p> According to Patently Apple, the Apple&#x27;s trademark application feature two parts: one for retail and the other for finance.
<p> The application does not reveal how Apple will be using the phrase, so we can&#x27;t make any solid conclusions on it. For what it seems, Apple will use a trademarked phrase for a new iPhone rental program directly from the company. As mentioned earlier, the final word rests with Apple.
<p> We will share more details on this as soon as we hear it. Share your thoughts with us in the comments.
