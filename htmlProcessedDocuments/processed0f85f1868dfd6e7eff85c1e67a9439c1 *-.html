<h> John Oliver is being honored with his name on a sewage plant after &#x27;fight&#x27; with a Connecticut town
<p> John Oliver discusses Danbury, Connecticut on his HBO show &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.&quot;
<p> (CNN)It&#x27;s official, a sewage plant in Danbury, Connecticut will be named after John Oliver after the comedian got into a tiff with the town&#x27;s mayor.
<p> The Danbury Wastewater Treatment Plant is now officially the John Oliver Memorial Sewer Plant after residents weighed in with their support and the town&#x27;s city council voted 18-1 Thursday in favor of the change.
<p> &quot;Yup.. It&#x27;s official the Danbury Sewer Plant is now the John Oliver Memorial Sewer Plant. - Your move John. Bam!&quot; Mayor Mark Boughton said in a Facebook post.
<p> It may not seem like a landmark you want your name on, but Oliver was instrumental in making it happen.
<p> The host of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; went after Danbury on his August 16 show during a segment on racial disparities on juries. In Oliver&#x27;s anti-Danbury rant , the host noted that he only knew three things about the Connecticut town: &quot;USA Today ranked it the second-best city to live in in 2015, it was once the center of the American hat industry and if you&#x27;re from there, you have a standing invite to come get a thrashing from John Oliver, children included, (expletive) you,&quot; Oliver said.
<p> Boughton responded by threatening to name the town&#x27;s sewage plant after Oliver in a Facebook video on August 22.
<p> &quot;Behind me you see the city of Danbury Sewer Plant, and we&#x27;re going to rename it the John Oliver Memorial Sewer Plant. Why?&quot; Boughton asked. &quot;Because it&#x27;s full of (expletive) just like you, John.&quot;
<p> The talk show host did not back down -- he upped the stakes.
<p> Oliver offered to donate $55,000 to local charities if the mayor followed through on his offer, and the city accepted.
<p> On September 6, Boughton commented back in a video that, &quot;A deal is a deal.&quot;
<p> It&#x27;s unclear why Danbury was singled out, but the city is not complaining.
<p> &quot;I never have seen such passion from something in the community...this takes the cake. I&#x27;m still getting emails!&quot; Boughton said in his weekly video update before the vote.
<p> In addition, the play spat has become a surprising means of raising money for charity, Boughton said during the city council meeting.
<p> In addition to Oliver&#x27;s donation, local organizations committed to raising nearly $100,000 more for the area&#x27;s United Way food pantry, according to the mayor&#x27;s office. Boughton is even selling tours of the facility in order to raise money for United Way.
<p> The mayor requested Oliver attend a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the newly named sewage plant. HBO, which like CNN is owned by WarnerMedia, did not immediately respond to CNN&#x27;s requests for comment on Oliver&#x27;s behalf.
