<h> Description
<p> Shotgun Farmers is an online multiplayer shooter where missed shots grow guns. Fire your bullets into the ground to plant your ammo. Reloading isn’t an option, so grab one of the deadly crops planted by the bullets of you and your enemies. Shot at by a sniper? Well they just planted you your very own sniper gun to fire back with! Harvest weapon plants quickly for more ammo or let them grow for a larger clip.
