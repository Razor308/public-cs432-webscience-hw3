<p> On Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Newsroom,” anchor Brianna Keilar examined how the highly unlikely scenario could play out.
<p> “Seems like he’s kidding, but these are the people he flocks to, people he says are fair,” Keilar said. “If his wish came true and they moderated a debate, do you think they’d really press him on the administration’s failed response to the coronavirus?”
<p> Keilar aired footage of various personalities on the widely watched conservative network stumping for Trump, defending the government’s catastrophic handling of the pandemic, and criticizing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
<p> “Clearly these prominent voices on that network won’t be moderating any debate other than amongst themselves,” Keilar acknowledged toward the end of the segment.
<p> “But we show you this because these are the people the president is listening to,” she said. “These people are giving the president a daily briefing and it appears this is the one he’s actually listening to.”
<p> A free speech demonstration staged by conservative activists quickly fell apart in downtown San Francisco on Saturday after several hundred counterprotesters surged the area, outnumbering and attacking those gathered, including knocking one in the mouth. A photographer working for The Associated Press witnessed an activist with Team Save America taken away in an ambulance and an injured San Francisco police officer on the ground by San Francisco’s United Nations Plaza. Team Save America organized the rally to protest Twitter, which it said squelches conservative speech.
<p> The three men vying to lead German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x27;s CDU party took each other on in an online debate Saturday in a bid to revive a race that has been knocked off course by the coronavirus pandemic.
<p> Millions of Europeans faced tough new coronavirus restrictions on Saturday as governments stepped up efforts to slow the surge in infections, after the World Health Organization reported a &quot;very concerning&quot; 44-percent rise in European cases over one week.
<p> Just what would it take to throw Strictly Come Dancing (BBC One) off its stride? Alien invasion? A robot uprising? Clearly it is going to require more than a once-in-a century pandemic. Because while Coronavirus has obviously brought complications to Strictly 2020 it hasn’t, on the evidence of a reliably glittery launch episode, sapped the heel-clicking juggernaut of any of its strut. The series sashayed to the starting line of its 18th season with face-mask on and hands sanitised. How hugely soothing it was to have it back. As the pro dancers opened with a routine soundtracked by the confetti-strewn strains of Rozalla’s Everybody’s Free, it was a pleasure to be ushered once again into this parallel dimension of twirls, tight trousers and toe-tapping thrills . Covid visibly made its presence felt as hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman kicked off the evening standing the regulation two metres apart. And there were only three judges – Craig Revel Horwood, Shirley Ballas, and Motsi Mabuse – seated at separate podiums. Crowd favourite Bruno Tonioli was absent. He’s in the US adjudicating on Dancing with the Stars (he will join by computer link up for the results broadcasts). The pro dancers, for their part, have pre-recorded all their group numbers having quarantined together. It wasn’t announced on air but backstage kissing between contestants and dancers is also forbidden for obvious reasons. So though Coronavirus hasn’t cancelled the reality institution outright it has temporarily put a halt to the Strictly Curse, whereby participants became romantically entangled off camera.
<p> Emmanuel Macron is using the post-Brexit trade talks to shore up his domestic standing in France, UK sources have claimed, as they labelled talks with the EU “performance art”. British sources said the French president was prioritising concerns about his political future over agreeing a free trade agreement with the UK, as he came under pressure from Marine Le Pen, the far-Right leader. Ministers privately claim that it could take “years” for the UK to return to the negotiating table if the current transition period ends without a trade agreement on Jan 1. Senior Tories have warned EU leaders not to expect to reopen talks next spring – by which point they believe the UK could already have experienced the worst effects of ending the transition period without a deal. On Friday, Boris Johnson accused European leaders of having “abandoned the idea of a free trade deal” and told the country to “get ready” for a no-deal outcome in the negotiations after his Oct 15 deadline for reaching an agreement passed. Senior Brexiteers praised the move, with John Redwood, the former trade secretary, claiming: “The UK will prosper more with no deal than with a bad deal.” Lord Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, told his counterpart, Michel Barnier, to call off a planned trip to London for talks this week, after EU leaders issued a joint summit statement calling on the UK to offer compromises on several areas, including fishing rights in UK waters.
