<p> OAKLAND, CAâ€”According to sources, one local citizen has discovered a way around the mask mandate: walking around slowly eating a bag of Cheetos the entire day.
<p> &quot;Hey, I can&#x27;t wear a mask when I&#x27;m eating, right?&quot; said Bush Ballinger, local genius and snack enthusiast. &quot;I&#x27;ve slowed my snacking to a snail&#x27;s pace, slowly bringing the Cheeto to my mouth and then chewing it for about 10 minutes. I&#x27;ve managed to stretch out one bag for 12 hours. No mask!&quot;
<p> State regulators are panicking as they desperately struggle to find a way to close the &quot;Cheetos loophole.&quot; The governor has said he plans to announce a temporary moratorium on public snacking. Legislators are also drafting legislation to ban Cheetos forever.
<p> &quot;We must stop this menace before it&#x27;s too late,&quot; said California Governor Gavin Newsom. &quot;SCIENCE has spoken and science will have the last word. I will not rest until this deadly plague of wanton snacking is defeated!&quot;
<p> Ballinger has a backup plan. If his state bans Cheeto snacking, he will simply walk around all day with a Starbucks cup to his lips.
