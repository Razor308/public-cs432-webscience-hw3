<h> Family raises tiny orphaned piglet found on a rural P.E.I. road

<p> Molly McGrath had always wanted a pet pig — and this summer, one fell from the sky.
<p> At least, that&#x27;s what they believe likely happened. McGrath works at a veterinary clinic, and a couple found a tiny piglet on a rural dirt road and brought her to the clinic for surrender. The vet said the piglet was newly born and had little chance of survival.
<p> She weighed less than 400 grams, just 0.87 pounds.
<p> McGrath, who with her family runs South Shore Soaps on a small farm with 20 goats in DeSable, P.E.I., wanted to give the piglet a chance.
<p> &quot;The vet did give her a grave prognosis,&quot; McGrath said. &quot;The umbilical cord was still attached, so we weren&#x27;t sure if she had received colostrum from the mum yet.&quot; Colostrum is the first form of milk produced by the mother and contains antibodies to protect against disease and infection.

<p> 5 days ago

<p> this little piggy was lucky to find a loving home after she was found on a back road in rural P.E.I. 1:12
<p> &quot;It was literally hour by hour the first few days,&quot; she said. Family members took turns getting up every two hours around the clock to feed Lilith goat&#x27;s milk and goat&#x27;s colostrum.
<p> &quot;Luckily, I have a teenager who loves to be up most of the night,&quot; McGrath said. &quot;It was really a family event.&quot;
<p> The vet continued to check on Lilith, and after the first week gave a guarded thumbs-up to the piglet&#x27;s chances of survival.
<p> This is Lilith right after she was found on a dirt road in rural P.E.I. The couple who found her said they searched the area for several kilometres in each direction but couldn&#x27;t find anyone who knew where she might have come from. (South Shore Soaps/Facebook)
<h> Scooped up by a bird?
<p> That was 12 weeks ago. Lilith is now thriving and living in the McGraths&#x27; house.
<p> They&#x27;re still not sure exactly what breed Lilith is, except that she is a miniature.
<p> And they&#x27;re still not sure where she came from. McGrath said the people who found her said they&#x27;d searched the area and knocked on doors for a couple of days but didn&#x27;t find anyone who knew anything about a miniature pig or even kept pigs.

<p> &quot;We think that she may have been scooped up by a bird of some sort and then dropped,&quot; McGrath said. &quot;Fortunately, her rescuers were at the right place at the right time.&quot;
<p> It looks like fate chose the right hands for Lilith to fall into. McGrath had already researched how to look after pot-bellied pigs. She also knew a breeder in Ontario, who helped advise her on caring for a newborn.
<p> &quot;I like to help wherever I can, especially with animals,&quot; McGrath said. &quot;And then, it pulled at my heartstrings seeing this poor little thing.… Everything for a reason, I guess.&quot;
<p> Lilith had to be fed every two hours for the first several weeks of her life. (South Shore Soaps/Facebook)
<h> Like a puppy but &#x27;smarter&#x27;
<p> Lilith has become South Shore Soap&#x27;s mascot — a little ironic, since the soap is made with milk from the family&#x27;s goats.
<p> She&#x27;s also a bit of a scamp. For instance, when the family had the dishwasher open recently, she tried to climb up on the door to lick the dinner plates.
<p> &quot;They are so intelligent, so smart,&quot; McGrath enthused. &quot;You need to stay one step ahead.
<p> Lilith weighed less than a pound when she was found, and the veterinarian said she might not live. Now, after 12 weeks, she is thriving. (South Shore Soaps/Facebook )
<p> &quot;It&#x27;s like having a puppy except, I think, a lot smarter,&quot; she said, noting it only took about three days to potty train Lilith. &quot;She&#x27;s really good at asking at the back door to go out.&quot;
<h> &#x27;Squeaking at the door&#x27;
<p> Lilith sleeps at night and naps in a dog crate, and runs freely in the house with the family&#x27;s other pets during the day, eating mini pig pellets from a dish on the floor as well as fruits and vegetables. She also likes to go outside.
<p> &quot;She does not like the cold, so she&#x27;s squeaking at the door wanting back in pretty quickly,&quot; McGrath said.

<p> McGrath said she is planning not only a product line around Lilith — Hogwash, anyone? — but also a children&#x27;s book and a puzzle from a local puzzle creator.
<p> &quot;Why not celebrate a little miracle? A good news story, for a change,&quot; she said.
<p> She estimates Lilith will grow to be about 27 kilograms, or 60 pounds.
<p> And she said she can&#x27;t imagine what she&#x27;d do if someone came along to claim Lilith.
<p> &quot;She has grown quite attached to us, and us to her,&quot; McGrath said.
<p> Lilith is smarter than a dog, the McGraths say. She sleeps in a crate at night, and they add a hot-water bottle to keep her warm. (South Shore Soaps/Facebook )
