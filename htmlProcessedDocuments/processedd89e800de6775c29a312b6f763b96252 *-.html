<p> &quot;All of us in some shape or form have had to find a new normal and I think it&#x27;s been less than optimal.
<p> &quot;Brodie&#x27;s form hasn&#x27;t been as strong as his last two years, and whether it&#x27;s got to do with hub life or whether it&#x27;s got to do with what&#x27;s been imposed on us or whether it&#x27;s just a down year, we&#x27;ll find out in the next couple of weeks.
<p> &quot;Brodie has been huge for this footy club for a long time. He&#x27;s a massive character and he provides so much energy and what he needs to do is rest and refresh and come back and do what he&#x27;s always done.&quot;
<p> Buckley added that the unique challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 had required Collingwood to constantly &quot;sweep&quot; issues to the side.
