<p> Migrants entering British waters across the Channel will have their dinghies &#x27;disabled by nets&#x27; before being sent back to France.
<p> Dan O&#x27;Mahoney, the new Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, has set out his four-stage plan in a bid to clamp down on illegal crossings.
<p> The former marine has reportedly confirmed how UK authorities are poised to deploy a &#x27;safe return tactic&#x27;.
<p> The move comes after it emerged that more than 7,100 migrants have reached the UK in this year alone.

<p> In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, Mr O&#x27;Mahoney said that personnel would render migrant boats inoperable before using British vessels to ferry the occupants back to France.
<p> The method is similar to that trialled by the Royal Navy to clog boat propellers to force an immediate stop.
<p> Mr O&#x27;Mahoney, who Home Secretary Priti Patel appointed in August, said: &#x27;We are exploring tactics to make safe interventions, in order to return migrants back to France...
<p> &#x27;We definitely are very, very close to being able to operationalise a safe return tactic where we make an intervention safely on a migrant vessel, take migrants on board our vessel and then take them back to France.&#x27;
<p> He added that this tactic was just one of many &#x27;which we may deploy over the next few months&#x27;.
<p> The number of clandestine arrivals is currently exceeding 300 per day - the greatest numbers on record - after a sharp decrease in air and rail travel by air amid the coronavirus pandemic.
<p> But the implementation of the new method will likely be delayed as France is currently refusing to take back migrants.
<p> Mr O&#x27;Mahoney also told the publication that the Government was using social media campaigns and officials posted abroad to urge would-be migrants travelling from Africa and the Middle East to claim asylum in the first safe country in which they arrive.

<p> It is hoped that this would deter them from risking their lives in an &#x27;incredibly dangerous journey&#x27; across the world&#x27;s busiest shipping lane to reach the UK illegally.
<p> Mr O&#x27;Mahoney insisted that his team&#x27;s first priority is still to save the lives of those put at risk by attempting to make the crossing.
<p> But added that this objective was closely followed by focusing on securing the UK border and increasing public confidence in the operations.

<p> The interview comes just days after proposals being worked on by the Home Office suggested migrants attempting to cross the Channel could be held on disused ferries.
<p> Government sources had insisted the ideas - which were leaked last week - were only part of a brainstorming session.
<p> But a source told The Sun: &#x27;There is a real determination to tackle this problem and things are now moving forward. The ferry plan is on. It&#x27;s happening.&#x27;
<p> Officials were told to begin discussions about buying two unused boats to turn into processing centres and keep off the coast of Portsmouth, sources said.
<p> Some Â£6million could buy the Home Office a 40-year-old ferry which could house 1,400 asylum seekers, The Times reported.
<p> Approval to house migrants in ferries has not been granted, a Home Office spokesperson said.
