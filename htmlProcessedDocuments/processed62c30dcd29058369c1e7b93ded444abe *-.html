<p> Luckily, a locksmith, only identified as &quot;Greg,&quot; noticed the woman had &quot;911&quot; written on her hand, and showed it to him while talking payments for services. He originally arrived to the home to change the lock in a door.
<p> &quot;She&#x27;s paying me and she&#x27;s still showing me the &#x27;911&#x27; again, kind of making sure that I saw it. And I made eye contact with her,&quot; he told KSTU. &quot;The lady was pretty smart you know, I mean, to be able to do what she did. And so, you know, it&#x27;s not like I was trying to guess what was really going on. I mean, it was pretty... you know, She gave me some great clues that there was an issue there.&quot;
<p> When cops showed up after the locksmith called police, the woman “quickly opened the door and walked fast out the front door and stated that [Eggertsen] was downstairs in the house,” authorities said.
<p> Eggertsen had a previous relationship with the woman, allegedly making threats against her, and Greg happened to come for a scheduled lock change because of those threats.
