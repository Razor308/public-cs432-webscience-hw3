<p> Ah, the Dreamcast. Virtua Tennis, Crazy Taxi, Soulcalibur and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 were among my favourites in the early 2000s. Alas, Sega&#x27;s ahead of its time console fell by the wayside, and the console war was never the same again.
<p> But, what&#x27;s this? A whisper the Dreamcast may come back - via the mini treatment.
<p> In an interview with Japanese magazine Famitsu, Sega&#x27;s mini chief Yosuke Okunari discussed what&#x27;s next for the company&#x27;s mini range, having already released a Mega Drive mini in 2019 and, in Japan only so far, the Game Gear micro.
<p> Siliconera translated his answers, and there&#x27;s certainly food for thought:
<p> &quot;I think for the next one, we may go with a concept close to the Mega Drive Mini. If I have to say some names, it could be an SG-1000 Mini or a Dreamcast Mini...&quot;
<p> Let&#x27;s be honest here, Sega isn&#x27;t going to make an SG-1000 Mini. The SG-1000 - and I had to look this up - was Sega&#x27;s limited release entry into the home video game hardware business. It came out in 1983, the same day Nintendo released the Famicom in Japan. It pre-dates the Master System by a couple of years.

<p> So, we have a Dreamcast Mini on the cards, and that makes a lot of sense, I think. The console enjoys a hardcore and loyal following even to this day, nearly 20 years after it was discontinued. Our Martin often remembers playing his Dreamcast, and then I sort of tune out as he mentions something about arcade ports and Seaman.
<p> Don&#x27;t hold your breath, though. In the interview with Famitsu, Okunari says the next mini will take some time:
<p> &quot;The Game Gear Micro is only sold domestically in Japan. When we do the next one, I feel like the project scope will be much bigger as we gaze upon the world. So we won&#x27;t be able to release it at this time the next year or two years after the Mega Drive Mini. We can&#x27;t make it that quickly [laughs].&quot;
<p> If Sega does release a Dreamcast mini next, then it means skipping a Saturn mini. That&#x27;s fine by me. I never had one of those. Was it any good?
