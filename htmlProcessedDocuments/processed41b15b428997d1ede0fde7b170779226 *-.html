<h> Microsoft makes remote work option permanent
<p> image captionNew guidance sent to Microsoft staff indicated that working fro home could become permanent for employees, if their manager agreed
<p> Microsoft has told staff that they will have the option of working from home permanently with manager approval.
<p> The move mimics the US tech giant&#x27;s rivals Facebook and Twitter, which have also said remote work would be a permanent option.
<p> It follows a rapid shift away from office working prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.
<p> Many companies are reconsidering how much office space they need, expecting a long-term increase in remote staff.
<p> Microsoft said some roles will continue to require an in-person presence, such as those needing access to hardware, the firm added. But many staff will also be able to work from home part-time, without needing formal approval from their managers.
<p> &quot;Our goal is to evolve the way we work over time with intentionâ€”guided by employee input, data, and our commitment to support individual work styles and business needs while living our culture,&quot; a Microsoft spokesperson said of the new guidance, which she said would apply to UK staff as well.
<p> While that share decreased to about 35% in August, it still marked a major change. Before the pandemic, just 2% of workers were remote full time, he said.
<p> &quot;What we&#x27;re doing now is extremely unusual,&quot; he said.
<h> Permanent shift
<p> Many employers hailed the shift initially as being surprisingly productive. But as the months have passed, some of the drawbacks have emerged.
<p> For example, at a conference this month, Microsoft&#x27;s own chief executive Satya Nadella said the lack of division between private life and work life meant &quot;it sometimes feels like you are sleeping at work&quot;.
<p> As companies look beyond the pandemic, Prof Bloom said many are eyeing policies that combine two days a week at home with three days of office time, which will remain important for meetings, building company culture and loyalty and basic mental health.
<p> &quot;The radical extremes - so, full-time in the office or full-time at home - are not ideal for most people,&quot; said Prof Bloom.
<p> But he said he did not expect the pre-pandemic office to return.
<p> &quot;The Microsoft statement is completely in line with everything I&#x27;ve been hearing,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#x27;s pretty much uniform consensus now that the pandemic has permanently shifted the way we work.&quot;
<p> About 55% of employers said they expected staff to work from home at least one day a week after concerns about the virus passes, a PWC survey found. And more than 80% of employees said they supported that idea.
<p> Analysts say such a shift could have widespread implications, reducing demand for office and residential properties in expensive city centres. Rents in New York and San Francisco have already dropped.
<p> Prof Bloom said the changes in the workplace may help ease affordability issues, but won&#x27;t spell the end of city centres.
<p> &quot;The affordability levels of New York and San Francisco may go back to where they were in 2005,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s clearly not the case they&#x27;re going to empty out.&quot;
