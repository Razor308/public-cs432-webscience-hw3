<p> There is, amusingly, a disclaimer at the end of the teardown video that stresses the “dust catcher does not guarantee the hardware clogging from dust” – but obviously it’s going to help you keep your console clean, which should help preserve its lifespan. Are you impressed by this minor feature? Dust off your Dyson in the comments section below.
<p> I mean if don&#x27;t hoover your at least once a week no wonder your consoles sounds like jet engines, I hoover and clean my PS4 Pro every other day obviously hoover my house every day. Dust &amp; smoke is the number killer of consoles, so glad Sony added this smart feature but like my PS4 I&#x27;ll be looking after it.
<p> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever vacuumed a console besides under the Wii dock. We don&#x27;t have any pets and nobody smokes anything in the house so that may be why I don&#x27;t feel the need. Maybe I&#x27;ll think about it next spring cleaning.
<p> @BrandNew098 I was talking about the opportunity of cleaning the fan itself. To do that, you have to disconnect it from the console (unless its cable is long enough). Removing the plate one can still blow on the fan some air to clean it as one can do with a PS4, but it&#x27;s way less helpful.
<p> I like the very much. They designed it in the way that would be very easy for everybody to add extra storage, to change the look (by replacing the side panels) and keep it clean. I believe they did an impressive work. The cooling system is huge and this time we get a very quiet and fast console. Can not wait to get my hands on it.
<p> @BNAG_Gamer Vacuum&#x27;s build up so much static electricity that running one over the PS5&#x27;s internals would almost certainly damage it. This is one of the most widely known things that you shouldn&#x27;t do when cleaning a computer because it destroys them very often, I am surprised your PS4 Pro didn&#x27;t brick the first time you did it and I would recommend never doing it again.
<p> That&#x27;s not true. You can remove the whole fan without removing the warranty sticker. All you have to do is remove a plate next to the warranty sticker to reveal the power plug and remove the black vents/fins on top of the console. After that, it&#x27;s a case of just unscrewing 4 screws and popping out the entire fan. You&#x27;ll only have to void warranty if you want to get to the motherboard of the console.
<p> Static in a vacuum hose isn&#x27;t so much caused by the hose, as it is caused by the surroundings where it is being used. The actual hose will conduct static electricity from other objects, and things like carpeting and dry households are static magnets. The process is created by the friction between a vacuum hose and everything else it is rubbed against, which is particularly the case during vacuuming. This could create a static electricity charge that can be transferred to you or any other object the hose touches. Since you change the attachment you&#x27;ll could be shock before your console ever will be, also plastic is a poor electricity conductor.
<p> @Heurtaux305 I hope so, but I&#x27;m still scared by the creepy sound made by the black &quot;thing&quot; near the little warranty seal (at min. 3.09 of the original video). It sounds like a sticker to me so I supposed it was part of the seal since it covers essential components.It will be great if we can properly clean the fan after few months, but it also sounds strange to me that they consider such an action as ordinary administration...
<p> Overall I was very impressed with the cooling design and how you can maintain it, they have thought about it being kept clean. And access is really good to the fan. With the Series X it’s restricted and a big box to collect dust and the only way to clean it is take it apart. To me this is a win for Sony.
<p> @Cycologist I had a few issues with my old ps3, but I&#x27;ve had my ps4 (standard) since about 5 years ago, keep it on a stand off from the floor and with enough room to vent, and I&#x27;ve not had any issues. I give it a wipe down, semi regularly, but otherwise, it&#x27;s been very minimum maintenance.
<p> I’ve never cleared dust out of a single console ever (well, unless you count blowing in the 8 and 16bit days). How dusty are these peoples houses!To sneer the question, I guess it’s good. Sounds like a quality of life improvement for people who do this.
<p> @J2theEzzo opening it and cleaning with a can of air can help a lot after 5 years. Combined with a clean install of the OS and you&#x27;ll definitely see some performance improvement. Even more so when you take the opportunity to replace the harddisk with a SSD
<p> I like it. It is obvious they listened to their customers about PS4 flows and tried to avoid having the same problems with the new version. To be honest, my PS4 Pro is still an awesome console, graphics is modern and sharp on my 4K HDR tv, the only flaw is that it is too loud when I play games like God of war or RE2. I am glad that won&#x27;t be the case with PS5.
<p> Until I saw this video I wasn&#x27;t aware people had to open their consoles up to clean them often, although I do remember those stories about the ps4 having roaches getting in the first model, so I guess a periodic check for any reason would be necessary for some people.
<p> I actually made the best purchase ever years ago for an electric dust blower and that thing gets rid of every particle of dust around my pc and ps4, but with that dust hole I am going to have more fun cleaning that.
<p> @710King Esd is actually caused by a combination of dust going up the hose and it hitting other particles and the tube walls and the nozzle rubbing on surfaces. As long as these are mitigated enough esd is not a problem. Also helps if the Humidity is higher since Esd is more likely to occur in dryer conditions. Don&#x27;t just spew nonsense on here scaring people, Sony&#x27;s engineers know what there doing and if it were a risk to the console, it wouldn&#x27;t be a design feature of the console. In the ps4 manual they recommend using a low powered vacuum to clean the vents of dust.

<p> @710King Just saying, don&#x27;t you think
the engineers behind the design of it took esd damage to the hardware into account if they were to put something like that in the console for that purpose? Pretty sure all the shielding surrounding the board is there for that, and a lot of other purposes. Also the shell, housing and casing are all probably esd safe as well. I personally have vacuumed my pro out once a week for almost 2 years now. Just to keep the dust level at its lowest. That&#x27;s the key I think. As long a hole crap ton of dust isn&#x27;t coming out and there&#x27;s enough humidity in the air, esd is at its lowest point of happening. Also mind the rubbing of the nozzle because that builds up static as well. Though any build up can be dissipated quickly since esd is relatively short lived. As long someone is careful enough no damage will occur. Not to say id advise using a vacuum either(on a ps4), but to each there own. I did it before I had any idea about esd. Now I know how to build a computer because of it. That happening made me study and learn the ins and outs of all tech. As long as you mitigate you will not kill your hardware. Yes, latent damage can occur and your hardware could fail months or years down the line. But repeated damage causes outright immediate failure(bricking) after enough damage has occurred.
<p> @bronson_r3apsHi buddy theres lots of subjects on this , although our technology has improved still people has been unlucky , electro static charge builds up on the nozzle, I repair and maintain pcs,laptops,iPads,tablets I use compressed air .I&#x27;m an i.t technician just how I was taught , I&#x27;m sure there will be to YouTube videos on this lol
