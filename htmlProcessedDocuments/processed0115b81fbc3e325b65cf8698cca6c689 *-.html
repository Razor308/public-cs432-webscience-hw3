<h> Love Yourself 承 &#x27;Her&#x27;
<h> K-Pop · 2017
<p> Editors’ Notes
On their most complex work to date, BTS deliver emotionally driven electro-pop/hip-hop hybrids in a bid for global appeal. &quot;DNA&quot; announces itself with seismic synthesizers, while &quot;Best of Me&quot; (featuring production by The Chainsmokers) drips with tender melancholy. But it&#x27;s the use of gender-neutral pronouns in &quot;Intro: Serendipity&quot; and the discussion of youth hopelessness in &quot;Go Go&quot; that help make Love Yourself the band&#x27;s most thought-provoking creation yet.
