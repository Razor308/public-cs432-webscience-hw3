<h> Joe Biden is challenging US President Donald Trump, who dismisses climate change warnings and who has been dismissive of Greta Thunberg.
<p> Swedish environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg on Saturday asked US voters to choose Joe Biden, saying the outcome of the US presidential election was crucial for fighting climate change.
<p> The 17-year-old founder of the &quot;Fridays for Future&quot; climate protests said on Twitter: &quot;I never engage in party politics. But the upcoming US elections is above and beyond all that.
<p> &quot;From a climate perspective it&#x27;s very far from enough and many of you of course supported other candidates,&quot; Thunberg acknowledged.
<p> &quot;But, I mean...you know...damn! Just get organized and get everyone to vote #Biden,&quot; she added.

<p> &quot;Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!&quot; Trump once tweeted.
<p> &quot;She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,&quot; Trump tweeted again after Thunberg addressed the United Nations with a furious challenge contained in the simple question &quot;How dare you?&quot;
<p> Biden on the other hand has reached out to Thunberg and hailed her commitment to the fight against climate change.
<p> Last month, the respected magazine Scientific American also urged readers to vote for Biden on November 3, the first time in almost 200 years that it has taken a political stance.
