<h> Jack White to honor Eddie Van Halen on &#x27;SNL&#x27; with touching tribute
<p> Jack White is honoring the late Eddie Van Halen on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; this week with a touching tribute.
<p> Hours before his performance, the 45-year-old musician took to Instagram to reveal some of his plans for the big night, sharing a gallery of images featuring a gorgeous cobalt blue guitar.
<p> &quot;I thought it could be a nice gesture for me to use this blue eddie van halen model guitar for one of the songs tonight on SNL,&quot; White wrote on Instagram Saturday afternoon. &quot;The guitar was designed by eddie (with a few customizations i had added).&quot;
<p> Next, White described the special bond he shared with the late guitar legend, who died from cancer Tuesday at the age of 65.
<p> &quot;eddie was very kind to me and saw to it that this guitar was made for me to my specs,&quot; White said. And even though he promises to pay tribute with the sweet gesture, that is where his tribute will end. But it&#x27;s all out of love and respect for the musical icon.

<p> &quot;I won&#x27;t even insult the manâ€™s talent by trying to play one of his songs tonight,&quot; he added. &quot;Thanks again eddie for this guitar and rest in peace sir.&quot;
<p> Fans seemed to really love the gesture by taking to the comments section of the post to express their appreciation.
<p> One person wrote, &quot;It is a thing of beauty ðŸ™Œ Such a lovely tribute to Eddie, Jack ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ He is greatly missed by so many, but his gift to the world is eternal. May he Rest In Peace.&quot;
<p> Another added, &quot;Youâ€™re such a classy human Jack. Have a great show. RIPlaying Eddie.&quot;
<p> The former member of The White Stripes most recently performed on the sketch comedy show back in 2018, when he played a pair of songs from his solo album, &quot;Boarding House Reach.&quot; White actually recorded that album with Van Halen&#x27;s guitar, and during the promotional tour of the record, he often spoke about him as an inspiration.
<p> &quot;Itâ€™s absolutely insane the things that he invented that we take for granted today,&quot; he continued. &quot;And I know heâ€™s always been a guy like me, who likes to work in the garage and mess with things. So I know his style of design was coming from the garage.
