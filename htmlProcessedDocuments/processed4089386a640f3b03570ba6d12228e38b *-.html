<p> Clay Quartermain is a high-ranking agent of the fictional espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., a &quot;blond-haired, fast-talking, grinning Burt Lancaster&quot; sort[2] who first worked with that organization&#x27;s storied executive director Nick Fury during S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s first conflict with would-be world tyrant the Yellow Claw, later revealed to have been a robot simulacrum of that Chinese-national Mandarin. Quartermain later became part of the U.S. military&#x27;s &quot;Hulkbusters&quot; operation, which attempted to capture and contain the Hulk.
<p> He became a fugitive and traveled with Rick Jones and the Hulk. He met his brother, a farmer. He testified in Congress about a mass murder committed by the supervillain known as the Leader who had detonated a gamma bomb in a town to obliterate.[3]
<p> Once more at S.H.I.E.L.D., Quartermain, along with many other agents, was seemingly killed by a self-aware, renegade &quot;Deltan&quot; variety of the agency&#x27;s artificial-human &quot;Life Model Decoys&quot;, and replaced by one such LMD.[4] The most advanced of the Deltite LMDs, it rebelled upon learning it was not human, and after several confrontations, perished.[5]
<p> Quartermain remained an ally of Jones, using her to bring down a conspiracy against the President of the United States.[9] He assisted Jessica in the investigation of Mattie Franklin, a young female superhero trapped in mysterious circumstances.[10] Quartermain later led a S.H.I.E.L.D. unit that rescued Jones from a HYDRA recruitment attempt.[11] A flashback reveals Clay befriended Jessica while she was recovering from a months-long ordeal with the Purple Man.[12]
<p> At a meatpacking plant, Quartermain was found, apparently dead in a suspected Red Hulk attack. The commanding officer of the crime scene was his old friend Gabe Jones.[13] It was later revealed, however, that his actual murderer was the now-insane Doc Samson. Quartermain had inadvertently stumbled upon a plot hatched by Red Hulk and Samson, and threatened to launch a full-scale investigation. This involved the Life Model Decoy of General Thunderbolt Ross, seemingly killed during a fight with the Red Hulk; Ross was actually the Red Hulk himself.[14]
