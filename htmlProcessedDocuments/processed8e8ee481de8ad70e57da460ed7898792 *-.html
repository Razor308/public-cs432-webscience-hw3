<p> &#x27;We understand that this sort of situation can create uncertainty,&#x27; wrote Lee.
<p> &#x27;However we have been assured at this point that the risk of exposure for other individuals at Trinity School who were identified as close contacts is no greater than the risk of getting the virus in the general community.&#x27;
