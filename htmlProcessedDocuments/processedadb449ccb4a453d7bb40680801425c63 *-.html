<p> LAS VEGAS, NVâ€”Joe Biden was asked yet again today if he plans to abolish the Constitution, overthrow Congress, dismiss the Supreme Court, and set up a Communist regime to take their place. Once again, Biden refused to answer the question, saying voters will find out whether he plans to seize the means of production and institute a one-party rule, U.S.S.R.-style.
<p> &quot;Look, if I tell you whether or not I plan to institute a new Communist order, establishing a glorious worker-led revolution that will lead us out of this capitalistic nightmare and into a paradisical utopia, that would become the headline,&quot; Biden said. &quot;That would be playing Trump&#x27;s game. So I&#x27;m not going to say whether I support this great idea.&quot;
<p> &quot;Don&#x27;t voters deserve to know this?&quot; asked a concerned reporter.
<p> &quot;No, they don&#x27;t deserve to know,&quot; Biden snapped back. &quot;And you&#x27;ll be the first thrown into the gulag, bucko, I tell you what. Write that whippersnapper&#x27;s name down, Kamala.&quot;
