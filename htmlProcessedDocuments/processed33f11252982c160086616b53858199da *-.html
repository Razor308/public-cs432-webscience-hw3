<p> Kellyanne Conway served as Counselor to President Donald Trump, before she quit the high-powered post this past summer after Claudia&#x27;s antics on TikTok hit headlines.
<p> The wayward teen slammed her mother&#x27;s boss and trashed her parents&#x27; marriage in short clips that went viral.
<p> Last week, Kellyanne confirmed that she and Claudia had both tested positive to Covid-19 and were isolating together.
<p> Following the news, Claudia took to TikTok claiming her mother had not been honest about her diagnosis, saying she had tested negative.
<p> Kellyanne clarified to the public that she had three Covid tests - the first of which did come back negative.
<p> In a subsequent video posted to TikTok, Claudia covertly filmed Kellyanne, who blasted her daughter for spreading misinformation about the diagnosis.
<p> &#x27;You&#x27;ve caused so much disruption. You lied about your f***ing mother? About Covid?&#x27; Kellyanne screamed, before the camera cut out.

<p> Kellyanne shared her own social media posts about Claudia, attacking the media for covering the actions of a minor.
<p> &#x27;Claudia and I are faring well in quarantine. Everyone else is negative,&#x27; she wrote on Twitter.
<p> &#x27;My daughter, Claudia, is beautiful and brilliant. She has access to top doctors &amp; health care and lives comfortably.
<p> &#x27;Like all of you, she speculates on social media. Yet she&#x27;s 15. You are adults. We have Covid, but it&#x27;s clear who&#x27;s really sick.&#x27;
<p> Kellyanne is married to Republican strategist, George Conway, and the pair have three other children in addition to Claudia.

<p> However, George sharply criticized President Trump while his wife was working in the White House, sparking speculation as to the state of their marriage.
<p> In August, Kellyanne and George both announced they were stepping back from their careers to spend more time with their children.
<p> &#x27;We disagree about plenty but we are united on what matters most: the kids,&#x27; Kellyanne wrote at the time.
<p> Despite her resignation from the Trump administration, Kellyanne attended Amy Coney Barrett&#x27;s Supreme Court nomination ceremony at the White House Rose Garden event on September 26.
<p> That event is now feared to have caused a Covid-19 outbreak among the Trump&#x27;s inner-circle, with Trump, First Lady Melania and several of their closest aides and allies becoming infected.

<h> Claudia Conway&#x27;s TikTok and Twitter tirades
<p> Claudia Conway, 15, has been openly feuding with her parents on social media throughout the summer and has gained thousands of followers on Twitter, TikTok and Instagram.
<p> The teen, who uses the handle @datjerseygirl, has gone viral for her ferocious views on Donald Trump, support for Black Lives Matter, trashing her parents&#x27; marriage and asking Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to hire her.
<p> Last week she retweeted a post from AOC which said, &#x27;Team AOC is hiring!&#x27;, and responded: &#x27;Let me intern for you.&#x27;
<p> Her TikToks have urged followers to leave one-star reviews for Trump-owned hotels, restaurants and golf courses and called for justice for black people killed by white police officers.
<p> In a video from April she wrote: &#x27;when our president for the next four years is either going to be a r@pi$t or a r@pi$t.&#x27;
<p> Claudia&#x27;s outspoken beliefs first gained traction at the end of June when New York Times reporter Taylor Lorenz shared several of her videos on Twitter, praising her as &#x27;an outspoken leftist TikToker.&#x27;
<p> Not long after, her attorney father George Conway attempted to intervene, telling journalists that neither he nor his wife Kellyanne would allow them to speak to Claudia.
<p> &#x27;To journalists: @kellyannepolls and I do *not* consent to any communications between you and any of our minor children, including our daughter Claudia. So desist. Thank you,&#x27; he wrote.
<p> A week later the dramatic teenager posted her &#x27;last tweet,&#x27; claiming that her parents were making her delete her profile.
<p> &#x27;My parents are forcing me to delete social media so this is my last tweet. apparently, i don&#x27;t have a platform! it&#x27;s fake! love you all so much. keep fighting!&#x27; Claudia wrote.
<p> But just two weeks after her social media ban, Claudia tweeted to reassure followers she&#x27;d &#x27;got her phone back.&#x27;
<p> She added: &#x27;probably wont have it for long though considering i&#x27;m about to revolutionize twitter brb (be right back).&#x27;
<p> She then posted and retweeted a flurry of anti-Trump messages, replying to one of his tweets calling him &#x27;racist, homophobic and tyrannical&#x27;, and labelling him a &#x27;golfing idiot of a president&#x27;.
<p> She wrote: &#x27;let&#x27;s stop giving mr. golfer attention and his supporters ammunition. for those eligible to vote, ESPECIALLY young people, you must #SettleForBiden.&#x27;
<p> She wrote directly to the president: &#x27;babe maybe you should stop calling COVID-19 &#x27;China Virus&#x27; and start calling it &#x27;America Virus&#x27; since it&#x27;s THRIVING in our country.
<p> The teenager added: &#x27;awe so where are your &#x27;condolences&#x27; for the ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND LIVES lost in YOUR country? yo i&#x27;m sorry but is this actually our president? he doesn&#x27;t even use correct english i&#x27;m crying.&#x27;
<p> A few days later she posted a video on TikTok claiming that her mother had her &#x27;arrested for fake assault charges&#x27; during a live stream.
<p> Claudia said she needed a lawyer in the post which was soon deleted.
<p> It&#x27;s a stark contrast to some of her earlier TikTok videos which had expressed anti-Trump views while asking followers to not attack her mother and father.
<p> &#x27;Just please no hate to my mom or my dad, they&#x27;re both amazing peopleâ€¦ and I love them so much,&#x27; she said on a video earlier this year.
<p> She has since outlined that although she and her father George, who is also an anti-Trump tweeter, happen to agree on the president this does not extend to their broader political beliefs.
<p> She wrote yesterday: &#x27;As for my dad, politically, we agree on absolutely nothing. we just both happen to have common sense when it comes to our current president. stop &#x27;stanning&#x27; (obsessing over) him.
