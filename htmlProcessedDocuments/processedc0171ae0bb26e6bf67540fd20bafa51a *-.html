<h> Virginia Beach man admits to creating loan scam business just weeks after getting out of prison
<p> Ronald A. Smith left prison in the summer of 2012 after serving close to seven years for an internet-based loan scam that he and his wife used to net millions.
<p> It didn’t take long for him to pick up where he left off. Within a month of his release, the former accountant created a new business nearly identical to the one that landed him in prison, according to court documents.

<p> But this time, his business partner was his new wife.
<p> Smith, 59, pleaded guilty Friday in U.S. District Court in Norfolk to wire fraud, engaging in an unlawful money transaction, and fraudulently collecting federal unemployment benefits. The maximum term he could get is 60 years in prison and $750,000 in fines when he’s sentenced in August.

<p> Smith and his wife, Terri Beth Miller, were arrested in August and charged with conducting a scam that investigators said collected almost $1.29 million from about 1,700 customers. The Virginia Beach couple also was accused of falsely filing for and collecting unemployment benefits during the coronavirus pandemic.
<p> Miller was released on bond immediately afterward and Smith bonded out a few weeks later. But he was ordered back to jail six days later because he violated the terms of his release by attempting to contact his wife, who is still awaiting trial.
<p> On Friday, Smith told U.S. District Judge John Gibney Jr. that he tried to commit suicide while out on bond because he was distraught about being apart from his wife. When the judge asked Smith if he had any mental illnesses, Smith said, “I suffer from a broken heart, your honor.”
<p> According to court records, Smith and Miller created an internet-based company called Business Development Group, then solicited customers who wanted help securing loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration.
<p> The indictment says the activity took place between August 2012 and February 2018. Smith was released from prison in July 2012.
<p> Clients of BDG paid an advanced fee to get help preparing their business loan packages, which included applications, financial statements and business plans. Most of the customers, however, never got their loans, or the money back guarantee they’d been promised.
<p> In his earlier fraud case, Smith and his former wife, Denise Kirkland, ran a similar business that they used to cheat more than 1,000 customers out of about $2.75 million. The couple fled to Canada while they were being investigated, but were arrested four years later when they tried to cross the border into Washington. Both pleaded guilty. Smith was sentenced to seven years, and Kirkland to three.
<p> Correction: An earlier online version of this story stated that Smith served about 5½ years of a 7-year prison sentence. Counting the time he spent in jail while awaiting trial, Smith actually served most all of the 7-year term.
