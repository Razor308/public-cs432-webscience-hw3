<p> WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan acknowledged that even as COVID-19 continues to surge across the world, &quot;there are no new answers.&quot; He said that although the agency wants countries to avoid the punishing lockdowns that have devastated economies, governments must ensure the most vulnerable people are protected and numerous measures must be taken.
<p> &quot;The majority of people in the world are still susceptible to this disease,&quot; Ryan warned. He said countries should focus not just on restrictive measures, but also on bolstering their surveillance systems, testing, contact tracing and ensuring populations are engaged.
<p> The virus continues to surge across Europe and elsewhere: British scientists reported this week that the COVID-19 outbreak is doubling every few weeks, French hospitals are running out of ICU beds, Germany may enlist the army to help contain its outbreak and Spain declared a state of emergency in Madrid as coronavirus cases soar.
<p> Ryan said lockdowns &quot;may be unavoidable where the disease has got out of control again, but we shouldnâ€™t accept that in every country, the return of cases should be seen with an immediate return of the need for lockdown restrictions.&quot;
