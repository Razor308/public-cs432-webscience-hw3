<p> As far as fan-made renders go, they don’t get much more professional than this. Giuseppe Spinelli – who made a bit of a name for himself earlier in the year coming up with some incredible PlayStation 5 hardware renders – has dreamed up a hypothetical Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales console, and his promotional trailer is so professional you could be forgiven for thinking it’s the real-deal.
<p> The system, as seen on Let’s Go Digital, features a large Spider-Man emblem, as well as webbing detail and a custom DualSense controller. Obviously with Sony selling through every bog-standard PS5 it can manufacture right now, we may have to wait a little while for Limited Editions – but this one certainly looks the part, doesn’t it? How much would you pay for a system like this?
<p> @TheIdleCritic if it can do blue and white - that suggests it has full rgb, well might do anyway could just be blue and an actual white led - might have to start with some paint experiments so i&#x27;m ready
