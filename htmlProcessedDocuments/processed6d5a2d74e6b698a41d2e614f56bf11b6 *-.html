<p> Lachlan McDaniel believes his arts degree was &quot;probably the best thing that ever happened&quot; to him, but the Wiradjuri man fears new laws passed this week will make it much tougher for other Indigenous students to get the same opportunities.
<h> Key points:
<p> Recent data shows social sciences degrees are the most popular choice for Indigenous students
<p> Under the new reform, the cost of humanities degrees will increase 113 per cent
<p> One of the Closing the Gap targets is to have 70 per cent of Indigenous youth in higher education by 2031
<p> &quot;I think that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students largely come to university to gain greater skills to serve their communities, and an attack on arts degrees that include things like Indigenous Studies will hurt us,&quot; Mr McDaniel said.
<p> According to the latest national data, 33 per cent of Indigenous students chose to enrol in social science degrees compared to 19 per cent of the general cohort.
<p> Experts are concerned the changes will disproportionately disadvantage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, by lumping them with more debt or deterring them from study altogether — scenarios which both stand to jeopardise national higher education targets agreed to just months ago.
<p> The reforms will see the cost of a humanities degree increase by 113 per cent, while a law or commerce degree would increase by 28 per cent.
<p> Mr McDaniel started studying an arts and law degree in 2005, after being accepted via a direct entry Indigenous program.
<p> &quot;Before I went to Macquarie University, my job was to work in a factory and I was pushing the hot and cold buttons into taps,&quot; he said.
<p> &quot;I realised what the value of an education was and that my passion was for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. And then I wanted to get a degree that would make me of service to our communities.&quot;

<p> While the employability of humanities graduates is often questioned, Mr McDaniel believes his degree changed not just his job prospects but also the fortunes of his family too.
<p> &quot;I went from a low-skilled job to being able to work in the not-for-profit sector, the private sector, I worked in tertiary education. None of that would have been possible without my humanities studies, my arts degree and my law degree.
<p> &quot;My dad was amongst the first cohort of direct entry students for the University of Western Sydney, he was a security guard, had just left the army as a soldier and didn&#x27;t have many employment prospects, before he studied.&quot;
<p> Experts say the reforms may undermine the new Closing the Gap targets, which aim to have 70 per cent of Indigenous young people with some form of tertiary education by 2031.
<p> All states and territory governments, as well as the Commonwealth, agreed to the new aspiration after years of negotiating.
<p> Jaky Troy, a Ngarigu woman and the director of the University of Sydney&#x27;s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research Department, said the reforms undermined the Closing the Gap targets.
<p> &quot;This strategy of increasing fees and making it more difficult for Indigenous students to go to university is very much a contradiction to the Government&#x27;s desire to see more Indigenous students better educated; it&#x27;s a major deterrent and people will think twice,&quot; Professor Troy said.
<p> She said the new laws would send the wrong message to Indigenous students aspiring to enter higher education.
<p> &quot;It&#x27;s a tragedy, and the Government will really need to support Indigenous students to feel positive about coming to uni — if anything, the fees should be being lowered,&quot; she said.
<p> Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt is hopeful the reforms will encourage students to pursue fields like teaching and nursing, where course costs are lower and job shortages exist.
<p> &quot;What is it that we need within our communities, which gives us the strength to advance all of the targets around the gaps now in health? Doctors and nurses, allied health staff,&quot; he said.
<p> &quot;We have shortages across a number of industries in Australia and it would be great for Indigenous students to think of those options and opportunities because they will continue to evolve and grow in demand.&quot;
<p> Mr McDaniel now mentors many Indigenous students and is not convinced the reforms will persuade students to enrol in disciplines that do not interest them.
<p> &quot;It disturbs me that the next generation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are having another hurdle put in front of them to access tertiary education and get the education that they want,&quot; he said.
