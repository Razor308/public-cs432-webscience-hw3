<p> Hobart is the capital of Tasmania.. I call them &quot;Tasweigen&quot; I don&#x27;t care what they are actually called, I&#x27;ll forever call them &quot;Tasweigen&quot; because it makes them sound inbred (at least in my mind it does)
<p> Don&#x27;t worry about Perth those fuckers are hanging out in mines and shit.
<p> Adelaide is the capital of South Australia.. umm the Mullet is alive and well in South Australia.. we call them &quot;Bogans&quot;
