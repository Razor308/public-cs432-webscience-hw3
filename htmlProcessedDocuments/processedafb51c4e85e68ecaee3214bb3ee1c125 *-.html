<p> CBT is a talking therapy which helps people deal with overwhelming problems by breaking them down into smaller chunks.
<p> It is suitable for children with severe anxiety too, and parents can be taught how to do it.
<p> &quot;It&#x27;s important not to suffer in silence,&quot; says Nicky Lidbetter, from Anxiety UK.
<p> She recommends booking an appointment with a GP and explaining your symptoms, but she says &quot;one path doesn&#x27;t suit everybody&quot;.
<h> Are children and young people affected too?
<p> &quot;Some are struggling, some are thriving because of a lack of pressure from school,&quot; says Prof Cathy Creswell, professor of developmental clinical psychology at University of Oxford.
<p> Her survey of children and parents during the first month of lockdown found an increase in feelings of unhappiness, anxiety and low mood among primary school children taking part.
<p> But parents of secondary age children reported fewer emotional problems, and teenagers themselves said their mood and behaviour hadn&#x27;t changed.
<p> This is reflected in another survey of 13 to 14-year-olds, which found they were less anxious during lockdown than they had been last October, suggesting there is huge variation among children of different ages.
<p> Be there to listen: Ask them how they are regularly, so they get used to speaking about their feelings
<p> Stay involved in their life: Show interest in it and the things that are important to them
<p> Support positive routines: Be a positive role model and support regular bedtime routines, healthy eating and getting active
<p> Encourage their interests: Being active, creative, learning things and being a part of a team are all good for mental health
<p> Take what they say seriously: Help them feel valued in what they say, and help them work through difficult emotions

<h> What are the triggers?
<p> Anything from worries about health and money to changes at work, school or relationships can cause deep-seated anxiety.
<p> During the pandemic, there have been many potential anxiety triggers such as fears over the virus, going outdoors, infecting other people, wearing masks and returning to normal life, as well as what the future holds.
<p> Callers tend to have more complex problems than normal and calls are lasting longer, the charity says.
<p> Psychiatrists are warning that lockdown and social distancing is affecting people&#x27;s routines and stopping them seeing friends and family. This can make any anxiety they are feeling even worse.
<p> There are also concerns that people aren&#x27;t seeking help for their mental health because of fears over the virus, and this is leading to an rise in emergency cases.
<p> &quot;If you feel unwell you can still get treatment during the pandemic,&quot; says Dr Billy Boland, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists.
<p> &quot;If you are facing mental health issues contact your GP or key worker, if you have one, and continue to use your mental health services as usual. If you are in a mental health crisis contact the NHS 111 online or telephone service.&quot;
