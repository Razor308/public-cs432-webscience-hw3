<p> This is not the first time protesters have targeted McConnell&#x27;s home for demonstrations. Following the announcement of Barrett&#x27;s nomination, members of the Sunshine Movement staged a &quot;wake-up call&quot; noise demonstration with a go-go band.
<p> &quot;Now McConnell will move at unprecedented speed to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, reneging on the rationale for blocking Obama&#x27;s pick for Supreme Court Justice in 2016,&quot; the group said in a statement at the time.
<p> Rallies were also held at the Supreme Court last month, when dozens of people called for the Senate to push off the confirmation hearings until after the presidential election in November.
<p> &quot;I feel a great deal of sadness combined with urgency to act,&quot; said Ana Maria Archila, who spoke to the crowd at the September 27 event. &quot;We want to tell every Democratic senator that every day you wake up from now until Election Day, your job is to protect people’s ability to choose their president.”
<p> Despite lawmakers contracting coronavirus, McConnell has said Barrett&#x27;s confirmation hearings will go on as planned. Hearings were scheduled to begin on Tuesday, October 12. McConnell said those hearings are &quot;full steam ahead.&quot;
