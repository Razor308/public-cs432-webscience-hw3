<p> A fan of PlayStation 4 cult classic Bloodborne has patched the legendary release to run at 60 frames-per-second, and now he’s hoping Sony officially updates the title ahead of the PlayStation 5’s launch next month. Lance McDonald utilised code from Dark Souls III in order to get FromSoftware’s legendary gothic action game running at double the framerate effectively on the PS4 Pro – and the results are startling.
<p> The original game has a fixed 30 frames-per-second cap, which means even when utilising PS5’s new Game Boost feature, it won’t see any meaningful improvements. Digging into the code and doubling the framerate breaks the game logic, but with the correct alterations, McDonald was able to get the title running beautifully at 60 frames-per-second on a PS4 Pro.
<p> With the game running this well at double the framerate on Sony’s mid-gen upgrade, there’s no doubt that it’d be smooth as butter on the PS5 – but it’d require a patch from the platform holder to support it officially. “Out of respect for PlayStation, I want them to have the first chance to put 60 frames-per-second Bloodborne into the hands of players,” he explained.
<p> If the company doesn’t update the game – and it’s worth noting that it never patched it for PS4 Pro – then McDonald will make his own alterations available for fans to download, but they’ll require a PlayStation console that’s capable of running unsigned code. We’re still hopeful that the Japanese giant will take the time to patch this fan favourite, because it’s part of the PS Plus Collection and one of the most talked about titles of the generation.
<p> So.. what are the odds that Sony would actually accept this code and release it officially? I suspect they&#x27;d be too security conscious to take the risk but it would be great to be able to play Bloodborne at 60fps. Guess we&#x27;ll have to wait and see.
<p> I know 60fps is all in vogue at the moment and it is nice to have but....
<p> Purely from watching I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference, I assume it may feel a bit different and hopefully it would eliminate the frame pacing issues of the engine it runs in.
<p> What I could see was a large increase in artefacts due to the lower resolution. Clear stair stepping where lines should be straight and the horrible shimmer that is a bug bear of mine on virtually every switch port.
<p> For me, I&#x27;d be very happy to see the frame rate capped at 60fps for the PS5 especially if we can get there at 1440p however if you need to drop sub 1080p I&#x27;m not on board. In that case just leave well alone.
<p> Yeah given that they never did anything to take advantage of the Pro, Sony and From really need to put the work in on the PS5, either with a remaster or with a patch. It truly is From’s masterpiece, and deserves a chance to shine on new and more powerful hardware.
<p> @Mintie that is what I assumed as well. That those games in the PS+ collection had mostly been selected because they worked with boost mode, or had been patched to work with boost mode.
<p> As to this modders work? Nice uplift, I always admire the modding community. There have been some damn fine software engineers that have come from the game modding community over the years, and this is a nice little fix / patch that he&#x27;s logically worked through and fixed. Shows a methodical mind, and that&#x27;s something a software engineer needs... and caffeine. Lots of caffeine.
<p> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;d be all about a 60fps version of Bloodborne, but I do honestly feel too much is made of the way it ran on PS4. I played through Bloodborne many times on my way to getting the platinum and never really encountered any issues around its performance, at least, none that stick in my mind as something that detracted from how fab the game was.
<p> Personally, I would be more excited for a PS5 version of the game which gives me another trophy list to work through, I&#x27;d be more than happy to cough up for that.
<p> Bloodborne does not need any patch; people who do not like it need a treatment.
By the way, I would pay again to play it at 60 fps being the most intense game I have ever played.

<p> @Nepp67 Aye but it&#x27;s probably true though. It&#x27;s cause they want them to make Bloodborne 2. Sony&#x27;s got the IP and FromSoft doesn&#x27;t want to atm, so Bluepoint is learning the ropes with Demon&#x27;s Souls and Bloodborne remaster. After that they&#x27;re moving to BB2.
<p> I think this is more or less an updated version of that article since the creator of the mod came out this weekend and said he would release the &quot;patch&quot; to the public if Sony themselves did not.
<p> And I am definitely on the wagon of no more remasters, remakes are ok for older games, but if Sony does choose to &quot;remaster&quot; this PLEASE make it an easy entry point on price. Tacking it on to another game and charging $20 won&#x27;t sit well with anyone (although I thought more people would&#x27;ve said the same about SM PS4 which is even younger than BB).
