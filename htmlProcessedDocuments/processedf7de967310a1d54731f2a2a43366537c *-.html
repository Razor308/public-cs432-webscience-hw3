<h> AMD Is Gearing up To Acquire Xilinx (XLNX) for $30 Billion
<p> AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), a major player in the semiconductor sphere, is gearing up to acquire Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) for $30 billion, thereby, providing an impetus to the ongoing consolidation wave in the industry.
<p> According to the sources quoted by Wall Street Journal, AMD and Xilinx are currently in an advanced stage of negotiation, with a potential deal emerging as early as next week.
<p> Bear in mind that Xilinx manufactures programmable chips for wireless networks and its acquisition will provide AMD a solid foothold in an industry that is currently in flux. With carriers injecting billions of dollars in the telecommunication sphere in order to expand the coverage of the next-gen 5G wireless network, Xilinx has become an important node in this endeavor.
<p> Of course, this move by AMD may also be a shot across the bow of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). As an illustration, the GPU-focused semiconductor giant has been on an acquisition spree of its own lately. Back in September, NVIDIA entered into a definitive agreement with the Japanese behemoth, SoftBank, to acquire ARM for $40 billion. As a refresher, ARM designs silicon chips and licenses instruction sets that govern how chips communicate. Moreover, ARM’s intellectual property – including the company&#x27;s Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) – is utilized by Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, Huawei, etc. for their smartphone chips, thereby, corresponding to a market coverage of around 90 percent. Additionally, NVIDIA closed its acquisition of Mellanox earlier this year, creating a viable avenue in the process to optimize its data center-based computing and cloud solutions. Mellanox has pioneered the InfiniBand interconnect technology, which in conjunction with its high-speed Ethernet products, is employed in over half of the world’s fastest supercomputers and multiple leading hyper-scale datacenters.
<p> The acquisition of Xilinx will also allow AMD to better compete against Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) sizable footprint in the data-center sphere. Moreover, the FPGAs produced by Xilinx will allow AMD to expand into the rapidly growing AI and networking segments, bolstering the company’s portfolio breadth.
<p> This development comes as AMD unveiled the new Ryzen 5000 series processors, based on the Zen 3 microarchitecture, on the 8th of October. We noted in our dedicated coverage yesterday:
<p> “The AMD Ryzen 5000 is highly anticipated because not only will it exceed the performance of the Zen 2 based processors, but Zen 3 is expected to deliver some major improvements in terms of IPC and also gaming performance, representing far better perf/$ values than the competition who have also announced their Zen 3 competitor but doesn&#x27;t launch until Q1 2021. Given how AMD has clawed away major share and gained historical wins over the competition in major retail outlets, Zen 3 will just push that lead further.”
