<p> Call of Duty&#x27;s latest game is just around the corner, and players are currently enjoying the Open Beta. However, a new reveal&#x27;s discovery is leaving a bad taste in our mouths.

<p> It&#x27;s not like players believed that Cold War wouldn&#x27;t contain microtransactions, however. The in-game purchases have long been a staple of the franchise.
<p> But Supply Drops themselves are somewhat controversial as a topic. A re-skinned loot box system, the crates can cause some real upset if not handled correctly.
<h> What Are Black Ops Cold War Supply Drops?
<p> For those not in the know, Supply Drops first made an appearance in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Since then, they&#x27;ve come to Black Ops 3, Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, and WWII.
<p> The system was initially set to be part of the latest Modern Warfare title, but instead, Infinity Ward made the switch to a Battle Pass system. The contents of these Supply Drops tend to be cosmetic in nature.
<p> Some games have the boxes containing emotes, weapon camos, and character skins. Others also add exclusive guns to the list of possible unlocks.
<p> It&#x27;s here that the main issue lies, as locking weapons behind a paywall creates an unfair and unbalanced experience. That&#x27;s without delving into the world of issues that stem from loot box gambling addictions.
<h> Are Supply Drops in Black Ops Cold War?
<p> According to a new leak, yes, Supply Drops are returning for Black Ops Cold War. Thanks to a bug in the game&#x27;s Beta, eagle-eyed fans have discovered references to the upcoming microtransaction system.
<p> It seems that when players plug in a mouse and keyboard to the PS4 Beta, they&#x27;re able to access a special, hidden menu. Clicking on the Message of the Day leads to a series of buttons becoming available.
<p> These locked features include the term &#x27;Purchase Crate&#x27; among other options. Also on the menu, players can find &#x27;Crate Bundle&#x27;, &#x27;Reserves&#x27;, and more.
<p> This may not be definitive proof that Supply Drops are returning, but we&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty concrete. It seems that Treyarch is keeping quiet on the matter for now, but ultimately it&#x27;s how they end up implementing the feature that will determine player response.
