<p> Watch the video above to hear what the 28-year-old suspect is accused of doing. Officials said he started multiple fires all over the Houston area.
<p> The suspect mostly set vehicles, trash cans and sheds on fire, according to Peña. There were no reported injuries in any of the arson cases.
<p> Peña said video from the incidents showed Rauch&#x27;s vehicle at the fire scenes, which allowed authorities to obtain a warrant to put a tracker on his car. Rauch confessed after he was brought in for questioning.
<p> It&#x27;s not clear how many fires Rauch has set, but officials are investigating and believe he&#x27;s responsible for dozens more. Peña said Rauch&#x27;s charges could be upgraded to first degree arson.
<p> Rauch appeared in court on Saturday night, and his bond was set for $50,000. His second court appearance is set for Monday.
