<p> In Virginia Beach’s unique election system, seven of its 11 City Council members are required to live in the area they represent, yet they’re elected by voters throughout the city.
<p> Critics of the at-large voting system say it discourages diversity and favors wealth and special interests. But efforts to change it over the years have repeatedly failed.

<p> Now, a federal judge is being asked to decide if it should be struck down.
<p> On Tuesday, a trial began in U.S. District Court in Norfolk in which two city residents are asking Judge Raymond Jackson to rule that Virginia Beach’s at-large system violates the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

<p> The trial is expected to last up to three weeks. Because of limited seating due to strict social distancing rules, a reporter from The Pilot, and even some of the attorneys assisting in the case, were not able to get into the courtroom at times on Tuesday.
<p> Residents Latasha Holloway and Georgia Allen, who filed their lawsuit against the city in 2017, are being represented by the Washington D.C.-based Campaign Legal Center. Lawyers with Virginia Beach’s city attorney’s office are arguing on behalf of the city.
<p> The lawsuit claims the current system unlawfully dilutes minority voting strength and denies minorities an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.
<p> Black people represent 20% of Virginia Beach’s population, while whites represent 67%, according to 2019 U.S. Census Bureau estimates. The city’s 11-member council has two Black members, and only five have served since the current system began in 1966.
<p> The system was upheld as valid by the courts in 1967. But court rulings involving other cities since then, including Norfolk in 1989, have forced them to switch from at-large to district voting systems.
<p> Virginia Beach voters have weighed in on the issue twice before. In 1994, they approved a switch to a district system, but some elected officials believed the referendum question was confusing and decided to ask them again in 1996. That time the proposed change was overwhelmingly rejected.
<p> In July, Council member Jessica Abbott sought to have the question placed on the ballot again this year, arguing that the city’s demographics had changed a lot in the past 24 years. The proposal, however, was defeated in a 5-6 council vote.
<p> The council members who voted no — Mayor Bobby Dyer, Vice Mayor Jim Wood, Rosemary Wilson and Barbara Henley — said they were concerned the public wouldn’t have enough time to learn about the topic with only three months to go before Election Day.
