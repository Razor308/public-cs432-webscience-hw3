<p> &quot;But you don&#x27;t have to wait until the middle of the night; even now, at nine or 10 o&#x27;clock in the evening, you&#x27;ll easily see it over in the southeast,&quot; says astrophotographer, Damian Peach. &quot;You can&#x27;t miss it, it&#x27;s the brightest star-like object in that part of the sky,&quot; he told BBC News.
<p> Even though this coming week witnesses the moment of opposition, it was Tuesday of last week that Mars and Earth actually made their closest approach in this 26-month cycle.
<p> A separation of 62,069,570km, or 38,568,243 miles. That&#x27;s the narrowest gap now until 2035.
<p> At the last opposition, in 2018, Earth and Mars were just 58 million km apart, but what makes this occasion a little more special for astrophotographers in the Northern Hemisphere is the Red Planet&#x27;s elevation in the sky. It&#x27;s higher, and that means telescopes don&#x27;t have to look through quite so much of the Earth&#x27;s turbulent atmosphere, which distorts images.
<p> Experienced practitioners like Damian use a technique called &quot;lucky imaging&quot; to get the perfect shot. They take multiple frames and then use software to stitch together the sharpest view.
<p> Damian&#x27;s picture at the top of this page shows up clearly the &quot;Martian dichotomy&quot; - the sharp contrast between the smooth lowland plains of the Northern Hemisphere and the more rugged terrain in the Southern Hemisphere. Evident too is Mars&#x27; carbon dioxide ice cap at the southern pole.
<p> The image was captured using a 14-inch Celestron telescope.
<p> &quot;That&#x27;s quite a serious bit of equipment; it&#x27;s not something you get on a whim,&quot; says Damian. &quot;But even a telescope half that size will show up all the major features on Mars quite easily. And if you&#x27;ve got a good pair of binoculars, you&#x27;ll certainly be able to make out that it&#x27;s actually a planet and not a star.&quot;

<p> It&#x27;s around opposition that space probes are launched from Earth to Mars. Obviously - the distance that needs to be travelled is shorter, and the time and energy required to make the journey is less.
<p> Three missions are currently in transit, all of which were sent on their way in July: The United Arab Emirates&#x27; Hope orbiter; China&#x27;s Tianwen orbiter and rover; and the Americans&#x27; Perseverance rover.
<p> Europe and Russia had hoped to despatch their ExoMars &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; rover, too, but they missed the launch window and will now have to wait until late 2022. That&#x27;s the penalty you pay when the planets align only every 26 months.
<p> Hope, Tianwen and Perseverance are all on course to arrive at Mars in February.
<p> In 2003, Mars made its closest approach to Earth around opposition in nearly 60,000 years - a separation of just 56 million km.
<p> The distance between the two at opposition can be over 100 million km, as happened in 2012.
<p> The variation is a consequence of the elliptical shape of the orbits of both Mars and Earth.
