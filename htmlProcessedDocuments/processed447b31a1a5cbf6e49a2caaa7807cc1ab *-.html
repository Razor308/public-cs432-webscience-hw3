<p> Big changes are coming to the PlayStation Store on web and mobile this month.
<p> Sony has sent emails - seen and verified by Eurogamer - to its development partners that warn the PlayStation Store on web and mobile will stop selling PlayStation 3, PSP or Vita games as part of a refresh ahead of the release of the PlayStation 5 in November.
<p> You won&#x27;t see PS3 games for sale on the web PlayStation Store from later October.
<p> The PlayStation Store on web and mobile will also stop selling PS4 apps, themes and avatars, and the content from your existing wishlist will be removed.
<p> According to the email, the following changes come into effect online on the 19th October, and on mobile on 28th October:
<p> SIE will no longer offer the ability for consumers to purchase:
<p> PlayStation 3 games and add-ons
<p> PSP (PlayStation Portable) games and add-ons
<p> PlayStation Vita games and add-ons
<p> Apps
<p> Themes
<p> Avatars
<p> The Wishlist feature will be discontinued and any items currently on consumer&#x27;s &quot;Your Wishlist&quot; will be removed.
<p> While this content will no longer be available to buy on the PlayStation Store via desktop or mobile, Sony&#x27;s email points out people will still be able to buy PS3, PSP or Vita content by accessing the PlayStation Store directly from their PS3 or Vita. As you&#x27;d expect, PS4 apps, themes and avatars can be downloaded via the PlayStation Store on a PS4 console.
<p> And, as you&#x27;d expect, you&#x27;ll still be able to access your previously purchased PS3, PSP or Vita content as before. Existing PS4 apps, themes and avatars will remain on your PS4.
