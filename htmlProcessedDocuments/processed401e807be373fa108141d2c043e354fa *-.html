<p> Donald Trump&#x27;s antibody treatment was developed with cells which are ultimately derived from an aborted fetus, it has emerged.
<p> The Regeneron &#x27;antibody cocktail&#x27; administered to the president was tested using a supply of HEK 293T human cells, which have been cloned and modified in science labs for decades but originate from the kidney of an aborted baby in the 1970s.

<h> WHAT IS REGENERON&#x27;S NEW DRUG, HOW DOES IT WORK AND CAN PEOPLE ACCESS IT?
<p> Donald Trump was given the antibody treatment REGN-COV2 on compassionate grounds by its US manufacturer Regeneron.
<p> The drug, which has not yet been approved for the treatment of Covid-19, is subject to clinical trials around the world.
<p> The cocktail of drugs targets two components in the spike protein of the Covid-19 virus, with the aim of interrupting its ability to infect cells.
<p> One of the antibodies in the &#x27;cocktail&#x27; is based on an antibody that mice produce in response to coronavirus, while the other is based on an antibody isolated from the one of the first US COVID-19 patients.
<p> The hope is that the treatment drives down viral load, keeping it from overrunning the body and sending the immune system haywire, and preventing the infection from becoming severe.
<p> REGN-COV2 is still in early trial phases, but the first data from its clinical trial found that it lowered viral load within a week and cut recovery time in half in patients that weren&#x27;t sick enough to be hospitalized. Regeneron has not yet studied the drug in severely ill patients.
<p> Do I have any hope of getting this drug if I fall ill?
<p> REGN-COV2 is currently being trialled globally, including in UK hospitals, where at least 2,000 patients will receive it.
<p> The Recovery study, co-ordinated by the University of Oxford, will assess the impact of giving patients the drug alongside usual standard care, to see if it lessens the severity of Covid-19 and can reduce deaths.
<p> Experts are hopeful the drug will work and can be pushed through regulatory channels quickly for widespread use.
<p> In the US, Donald Trump has said he plans to seek emergency use authorisation from federal agencies for the medicine’s use.
<p> What else did Donald Trump receive?
<p> Thanks to the UK-led Recovery trial, which includes 176 UK hospital sites, a cheap steroid called dexamethasone was found in June to save the lives of people with severe Covid infection.
<p> The widely available drug, which is now being used globally, was found to cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators.
<p> For those needing some form of oxygen treatment but not a ventilator, it cut deaths by a fifth.
<p> The drug works like a regular steroid by calming the immune system, but can have side-effects such as irritability and difficulty sleeping.
<p> Patients in UK hospitals now have access to dexamethasone if their doctors feel they would benefit from it.
<p> Trump also received remdesivir, an antiviral drug that was first developed as a treatment for Ebola, and works by disrupting the virus’ ability to replicate.
<p> Clinical trials have shown the drug cuts the duration of symptoms from 15 days to 11, but there is no data yet on survival.
<p> The European Commission has sealed a deal with pharmaceutical company Gilead to buy 500,000 treatment courses of remdesivir, to ensure it can be stockpiled.
<p> This means countries including the UK can continue to purchase the drug for widespread use.

<p> HEK 293 is a &#x27;human cell lineage&#x27; which ultimately derives from the kidney of a fetus which was aborted in the Netherlands around 1973.
<p> One sub-group is 293T cells, which are widely used in biological research.
<p> The use of HEK 293 cells to test Covid-19 vaccines has previously led to objections from Catholic groups and pro-life medical workers, although the Vatican has indicated in the past that it is permissible.
<p> In 2017, the Vatican&#x27;s Pontifical Academy for Life said in reference to other vaccines that &#x27;currently used cell lines are very distant from the original abortions&#x27;.
<p> &#x27;We believe that all clinically recommended vaccinations can be used with a clear conscience and that the use of such vaccines does not signify some sort of cooperation with voluntary abortion,&#x27; the Academy said.
<p> Regeneron says the 293T cells were used to make &#x27;pseudoparticles&#x27;, small structures which resemble the Covid-19 virus.
<p> These dummy viruses are then used to test whether the &#x27;antibody cocktail&#x27; would be effective at combating Covid-19.
<p> Trump has embraced anti-abortion rhetoric as a Republican candidate and as president, although before entering politics he expressed pro-choice views.
<p> In January, Trump became the first sitting president to speak at the March for Life anti-abortion rally, claiming that &#x27;unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House&#x27;.
<p> Abortion rights groups fear that Trump&#x27;s Supreme Court picks - including the pending nomination of Amy Coney Barrett - will lead to abortion rights being weakened or eliminated.
<p> However, the rule was struck down months later by a federal judge who said it was unconstitutional for the government to withhold billions of dollars of funding from hospitals, clinics, universities and other healthcare providers that did not comply.
<p> Despite these positions, Trump touted the success of Regeneron in a video filmed at the White House on Wednesday in which he promised it would be made free to Americans.
<p> &#x27;Within a very short period of time they gave me Regeneron, it&#x27;s called Regeneron, and other things too but I think this was the key,&#x27; he said of his treatment.
<p> &#x27;It was, like, unbelievable. I felt good immediately. I felt as good three days ago as I do now.
<p> &#x27;So I just want to say, we have Regeneron, we have a very similar drug from Eli Lilly, and they&#x27;re coming out, and we&#x27;re trying to get them on an emergency basis.&#x27;
<p> Regeneron&#x27;s &#x27;cocktail&#x27; includes some antibodies manufactured by the firm&#x27;s scientists, and others extracted from people who have recovered from Covid-19.
<p> While the ultimate goal is a vaccine which coaches the body to make its own antibodies, scientists are already combing through antibodies from recovered patients to find the most effective out of thousands.
<p> The antibodies in Regeneron&#x27;s product are meant to attach themselves to the distinctive &#x27;spike&#x27; protein of the Covid-19 virus, knocking it out of shape.
