<p> A report by 9News NBC Denver confirms the suspect is a private security guard hired by the station. The local NBC affiliate reports:
<p> A 9NEWS producer and a 9NEWS contractor were taken into custody.
<p> DPD has since said that one of the two people taken into custody was not involved in the incident but was a person of interest at the time. The 9NEWS producer is no longer in police custody and is not a suspect.
<p> A private security guard who was hired by 9NEWS is the suspect detained by DPD. It has been the practice of 9NEWS for a number of months to hire private security to accompany staff at protests.
<p> A man live-streaming the event captured the moment of the shooting. At about the same time, a cloud of orange mace can be seen and a gunshot heard. The incident happened with police about 25 yards away. Officers quickly responded and took a man believed to be the shooter into custody.
<p> A video shows a man wearing a “Black Guns Matter” shirt engaging in an argument with the man who is about to be shot. He does not appear to be directly involved in the shooting. As the victim walks off-camera to the right, the camera operator turns and captures the victim recoiling from the impact of the shot and falling to the ground.
<p> The Denver Postreports that “a man participating in a ‘Patriot Rally’ that also included a presence of self-described BLM-Antifa protesters, sprayed mace at another man and that man shot him with a handgun.”
