<p> WASHINGTON, D.C.â€”While battling the darkest monster from the pit of hell, known as &quot;COVID,&quot; Donald the Orange fell to his doom several days ago, sacrificing himself to save America from the deadly demon.
<p> So Americans were ecstatic to learn that Donald the Orange had returned in a new, better form, now known as Donald the White. A brilliant white light shone from Walter Reed Medical Center as Donald the White emerged just in time to save America from COVID, Antifa, and the Deep State.
<p> &quot;I come back to you now at the turn of the tide!&quot; he cried as he rode triumphantly out in the presidential limousine, codenamed &quot;Shadowfax,&quot; cutting right through the ravenous hordes of Antifa counterprotesters blocking the way.
<p> &quot;Yes...&quot; he said as he sat in the back of Shadowfax. &quot;Yes... Donald the Orange... that is what they used to call me.&quot; The newly revived president has a newfound passion for life and even more energy than before, though sources say he&#x27;s also taken up smoking.
<p> Donald the White says he will use his newfound powers to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border, shouting at would-be immigrants, &quot;You shall not pass!&quot;
