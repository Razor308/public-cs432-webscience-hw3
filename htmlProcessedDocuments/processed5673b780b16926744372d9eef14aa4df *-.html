<p> The Office for National Statistics figures came despite the success of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme.
<p> In August, the government-funded discounts on meals enticed diners to pubs and restaurants in droves.
<p> August was still the fourth month of growth in a row, but it was much weaker than the 9.1 per cent boost in June and the 6.4 per cent rise in July.

<p> The food and drink sector shot up by 69.7 per cent in August. The accommodation sector grew by 76 per cent as travel restrictions caused a boom in ‘staycations’.
<p> But there are now fears over what the next few months will hold, as businesses prepare to make lay off huge numbers of staff. Chancellor Rishi Sunak acknowledged that it may be a ‘difficult winter’ for many.
