<p> The Washington Post is reporting that the private school attended by Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s children has a current COVID-19 outbreak – and it occurred following the infamous “Rose Garden massacre” event at the White House.
<p> “We understand that this sort of situation can create uncertainty,” the school principal, John A. Lee, wrote in the email to parents. “However we have been assured at this point that the risk of exposure for other individuals at Trinity School who were not identified as close contacts is no greater than the risk of getting the virus in the general community.”

<p> A White House official who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity said Barrett’s children “have tested negative, never showed symptoms and were kept out of school after revelations that some who attended the White House ceremonies had tested positive. The official did not specify how long the children stayed home, but said the school approved their return to the classroom.”
<p> “The health and safety of our students, their families, and our faculty and staff, is of utmost concern, as is protecting the privacy and health information of our school community,” Balsbaugh said.

<h> John Bolton urged his staff to avoid Russian-manipulated Rudy Giuliani while the White House ignored it
<p> When Former National Security Adviser John Bolton received a warning about President Donald Trump&#x27;s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani due to his suspected ties to Russian operatives, he wasted no time heeding the warning and urged his staff to steer clear of having any involvement or interactions with
<p> The Daily Beast compiled a report based on what the publication described as &quot;interviews with 11 knowledgeable sources&quot; detailing Bolton&#x27;s repeated attempts to maintain distance between his department and Giuliani.
<h> Trump World’s desperate Hunter Biden pseudo-scandal backfired on them in record time
<p> Welcome to another edition of What Fresh Hell?, Raw Story’s roundup of news items that might have become controversies under another regime, but got buried – or were at least under-appreciated – due to the daily firehose of political pratfalls, unhinged tweet storms and other sundry embarrassments coming out of the current White House.
<p> In the course of one week, we&#x27;ve moved from The New York Post&#x27;s supposed &quot;blockbuster&quot; proving that Hunter Biden had arranged a meeting between an official with Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian gas company whose board the younger Biden sat on, and then-Vice President Joe Biden to a contrived controversy over Twitter banning the story from its platform because it contained personal email addresses and phone numbers and we ended up with reports about Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s apparent involvement in a clumsy scheme to launder hacked emails through a Seth Rich-truther at a computer shop, the likelihood that the emails were forged and the FBI investigating the whole thing as a disinformation campaign undertaken by foreign adversaries. When they rolled out the &quot;story&quot; on Monday, they probably didn&#x27;t expect headlines like &quot;Rudy: Only ‘50/50’ Chance I Worked With a ‘Russian Spy’ to Dig Dirt on Bidens&quot; to be prevalent by Saturday.
<h> Is the pandemic making us drink more, or less? It’s complicated
<p> Are people drinking more or less during the pandemic? It&#x27;s a question that&#x27;s been on the mind of researchers, and the public alike. Humans often turn to alcohol in difficult times, which comes with its own problems: research shows that when you turn to drinking to cope with stress it&#x27;s more likely to turn into a problem. Yet as recently as last year, studies found that American millennials just weren&#x27;t that into drinking, perhaps because of related trends in wellness and healthy lifestyles.
