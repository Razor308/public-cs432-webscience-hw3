<p> Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu are on a shortlist of Republican governors who did not sign a letter that supports the confirmation of President Donald Trump&#x27;s Supreme Court nominee.In the letter, which was addressed to U.S. Senate leadership, 24 of the nation&#x27;s 28 Republican governors said they strongly support the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett and urged the Senate to confirm her appointment as an associate justice.Baker, Sununu, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan did not sign the letter.Shortly after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Baker urged Trump and members of the Senate to wait until after the Nov. 3 presidential election to nominate and confirm a new justice.&quot;The Supreme Court is too important to rush and must be removed from partisan political infighting,&quot; Baker tweeted.The governor of Massachusetts has also been critical of the president&#x27;s responses during the COVID-19 pandemic and the social justice reform movement.Hogan and Scott have also been critical of Trump on many issues, while Sununu has criticized Trump at times for some of his comments, but generally supports his economic policies.Asked why Sununu did not sign the letter, Sununu campaign spokesperson Ben Vihstadt said, “As governor, Chris Sununu has no role in the confirmation process.”State Democrats pointed out, however, that Sununu signed RGA letters supporting Trump&#x27;s previous nominations of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.In public comments so far, the governor has not opposed the timing of the Barrett nomination and confirmation process but has not specifically voiced support for, or opposition to, Barrett, either.WMUR political reporter John DiStaso contributed to this report.
