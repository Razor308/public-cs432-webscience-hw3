<p> The declaration advocates for individuals at lower risk of dying from this virus to resume their normal lives, by working away from home, socialising in bars and restaurants, and gathering in crowds at sports and cultural events. Most of these lower-risk people would then contract the infection but not die. The declaration assumes that this would lead to a build-up of immunity in the population that would eventually also protect higher-risk people from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.[5] The declaration makes no mention of physical distancing and masks, nor of testing and tracing,[4] nor of &quot;long COVID&quot;, which has left many fit and young people suffering from debilitating symptoms months after a mild infection.[6][7]
<p> Critics of the declaration&#x27;s recommendations, including academics and the World Health Organization, have stated that the proposed strategy is dangerous and unethical, that it would be impossible to shield those who are medically vulnerable, that the long-term effects of COVID-19 are still not fully understood, and that the herd immunity component of the strategy is undermined by the limited duration of post-infection immunity.[5][8]
<h> Declaration contents
<p> The brief declaration, which has been translated into more than 20 languages,[11] advocates a strategy the authors call &quot;focused protection&quot;. They want to end stay-at-home orders and other mandatory restrictions on activities.[5] Instead, they want individual people, based upon their own perception of their risk of dying from COVID-19 and other personal circumstances, to personally choose the risks, activities and restrictions they prefer.[12] The declaration says that lockdowns have adverse effects on physical and mental health, for example, because people postpone preventive healthcare.[5] The authors say that the focus should instead be on &quot;shielding&quot; those most at risk, with few mandatory restrictions placed on the remainder of the population.[5] They believe that herd immunity (the idea that when enough people become immune, then the virus will stop circulating widely) will eventually make it less likely that high-risk people will be exposed to the virus.[5]
<p> Having been intentionally kept to a short, single-page statement devoid of details &quot;in order to make it more publicly-appealing and accessible&quot;,[12] the declaration omits practical details about who should be protected or how they can be protected.[2] It does not mention testing any people outside of nursing homes, does not mention contact tracing, does not mention wearing masks, and does not mention social distancing.[2] It mentions multi-generational households but does not provide any information about how, for example, low-risk people can get infected without putting high-risk members of their household at risk of dying.[2]
<p> The declaration names specific economic changes that the signatories favour: resuming &quot;life as normal&quot;, with schools and universities open for in-person teaching and extracurricular activities, re-opening offices, restaurants, and other places of work, and resuming mass gatherings for cultural and athletic activities. By October, many of these things had already happened in some parts of the world,[2] but likewise were being restricted elsewhere; for instance the UK saw quarantines of students, travel advisories, restrictions on meeting other people, and partial closures of schools, pubs and restaurants.[13]
<h> Authors
<p> The authors of the Great Barrington Declaration at the American Institute for Economic Research. (L–R) Martin Kulldorff, Sunetra Gupta, Jay Bhattacharya
<p> Sunetra Gupta, an epidemiologist at the Oxford UniversityDepartment of Zoology,[14] has been a critic of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic lockdown strategy, arguing that the cost is too high for the poorest in society. She led a group which in March released a widely criticized modelling study suggesting that half the population of the United Kingdom might already have been infected with COVID-19,[15] and in September a study which argued herd immunity thresholds might be lower than expected due to pre-existing immunity in the population.[16] She was one author of a 21 September letter to the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, recommending shielding of vulnerable groups of people rather than the lock-down method of the British government response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[17] Of the declaration&#x27;s signatories, Gupta said: &quot;we&#x27;re saying, let&#x27;s just do this for the three months that it takes for the pathogen to sweep through the population&quot;, arguing the situation would be only temporary.[4]
<p> Martin Kulldorff, a professor of medicine and biostatistician, has defended Sweden&#x27;s response to the pandemic[22] and along with Bhattacharya wrote a Wall Street Journal editorial arguing against testing the young and healthy for SARS-CoV-2.[23] Kulldorf told the National Post that people under 50 years old &quot;should live their normal lives unless they have some known risk factor&quot; while &quot;anybody above 60, whether teacher or bus driver or janitor I think should not be working – if those in their 60s can’t work from home they should be able to take a sabbatical (supported by social security) for three, four or whatever months it takes before there is immunity in the community that will protect everybody&quot;.[4] He did not explain what people between these ages should do.[4] While Gupta has said in a promotional video that less vulnerable people should be allowed &quot;to get out there and get infected and build up herd immunity&quot;, Kulldorff cautioned against deliberately seeking out infection; he said that &quot;everybody should wash their hands and stay home when sick&quot;.[4] Kulldorf disagreed with criticism the plan would lead to more deaths, calling it &quot;nonsense&quot;.[4] He said &quot;fewer older people – not zero, but fewer old people – would be infected. But you’ll have more young people infected, and that&#x27;s going to reduce the mortality.&quot;[4]
<p> On 9 October 2020, several media outlets reported that dozens of obviously bogus names were among the then 175,000 signatures of support for the declaration, including &quot;Mr Banana Rama&quot;, &quot;Dr Johnny Fartpants&quot;, &quot;Dr Person Fakename&quot;, &quot;Harold Shipman&quot;, &quot;Professor Notaf Uckingclue&quot;, and &quot;Prof Cominic Dummings&quot;.[26][27][28] More than 100 psychotherapists, numerous homeopaths, physiotherapists, massage therapists, and other non-relevant people were found to be signatories, including a performer of Khoomei – a Mongolian style of overtone singing – described as a &quot;therapeutic sound practitioner&quot;.[27] In response, Jay Bhattacharya regretted that &quot;some people have abused our trust by adding false names&quot;, which he supposed was &quot;inevitable&quot;. However, he added that &quot;given the volume of correspondence I have received from medical and public health professionals, as well as scientists and epidemiologists, it is clear that a very large number of experts resonate with the message of the declaration and its call for a focused protection policy&quot;.[28] In an interview on October 8, 2020 Jay Bhattacharya, one of the three main signatories, had said that the support they received was overwhelming.[29] As of 17 October 2020[update], the website showed 10,337 Medical &amp; Public Health Scientists and 28,286 Medical practitioners among its signatories, which also included more than 500,000 &#x27;concerned citizens&#x27;.[30]
<h> Reception
<h> Critical commentaries
<p> WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has characterized the herd immunity concept proposed in the Great Barrington Declaration as &quot;scientifically and ethically problematic&quot;.[8][31]
<p> Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, warned against the idea of letting the virus spread in order to achieve herd immunity at an October 12 press briefing, calling the notion &quot;unethical&quot;. He said: &quot;Herd immunity is a concept used for vaccination, in which a population can be protected from a certain virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached … Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing them to it.&quot;[8][31] Tedros said that trying to achieve herd immunity by letting the virus spread unchecked would be &quot;scientifically and ethically problematic&quot;, especially given that the long-term effects of the disease are still not fully understood.[8][31] He said that though &quot;there has been some discussion recently about the concept of reaching so-called &#x27;herd immunity&#x27; by letting the virus spread&quot;, &quot;never in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an outbreak, let alone a pandemic.&quot;[8][31][32]
<p> United States infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci called the proposals in the Great Barrington Declaration &quot;nonsense and very dangerous&quot;.[40]
<p> Anthony Fauci, the director of the American National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and lead member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, called the declaration &quot;ridiculous&quot;, &quot;total nonsense&quot; and &quot;very dangerous&quot;, saying that it would lead to a large number of avoidable deaths.[40][41] Fauci said that 30 percent of the population had underlying health conditions that made them vulnerable to the virus and that &quot;older adults, even those who are otherwise healthy, are far more likely than young adults to become seriously ill if they get COVID-19.&quot;[41] He added, &quot;this idea that we have the power to protect the vulnerable is total nonsense because history has shown that that&#x27;s not the case. And, and if you talk to anybody who has any experience in epidemiology and infectious diseases, they will tell you that that is risky, and you&#x27;ll wind up with many more infections of vulnerable people, which will lead to hospitalizations and deaths. So I think that we just got to look that square in the eye and say it&#x27;s nonsense.&quot;[41] The Infectious Diseases Society of America, representing over 12,000 doctors and scientists, released a statement calling the Great Barrington Declaration&#x27;s proposals &quot;inappropriate, irresponsible and ill-informed.&quot;[11]
<p> David Naylor, co-chair of the Government of Canada&#x27;s COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, told the National Post: &quot;Obviously, the Great Barrington fix will excite the minimizers who pretend COVID-19 is not much worse than the flu and enliven the libertarians who object to public health measures on principle … So be it: they&#x27;ve been offside all along&quot;.[4] Naylor also pointed out that a study published in August in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine examined Sweden&#x27;s &quot;no-lockdown&quot; policy&#x27;s effect on herd immunity among the Swedish population, finding it did not improve herd immunity despite higher rates of hospitalization and death than in neighbouring countries.[4][42] According to Naylor, the policy advocated by signatories of the declaration would never be the &quot;controlled demographic burn that some zealots imagine&quot;, and because of exponential growth of infections would lead to a situation where &quot;with masses of people sick in their 40s and 50s; hospitals will be over-run and deaths will skyrocket as they did in Italy and New York&quot;.[4] With the prospect of a vaccine available within months, Naylor questioned the logic of the Great Barrington strategy, asking: &quot;Why on earth should we rush to embrace a reckless prescription for a demographically-selective national &#x27;chickenpox party&#x27; involving a dangerous pathogen?&quot;[4]
<p> Harvard University professor of epidemiology William Hanage criticized the logic of the declaration&#x27;s signatories: &quot;After pointing out, correctly, the indirect damage caused by the pandemic, they respond that the answer is to increase the direct damage caused by it&quot;, and attacked the feasibility of the idea of &quot;Focused Protection&quot; for those vulnerable to severe infection, saying that &quot;stating that you can keep the virus out of places by testing at a time when the White House has an apparently ongoing outbreak should illustrate how likely that is.&quot;[5] He asked, &quot;How would you keep the virus out if 10 percent of the younger population is infected at peak prevalence and with tests that cannot keep the virus out of the White House?&quot;[43] He called the declaration &quot;quite dangerous, for multiple reasons&quot;, explaining that &quot;if you do this, you’ll get more infections, more hospitalizations and more deaths&quot; and that &quot;the greatest risk of introduction to the most vulnerable communities will be when the rate of infection is really high in younger age groups.&quot;[43] Hanage cautioned that uncontrolled infections among the young run the risk of long-term medical effects of the disease.[5] He added that &quot;we tend to make contacts with people around our own age, and given that none of the older generations would have immunity, they&#x27;d be in contact networks at risk of devastating outbreaks&quot; and further explained that blanket lockdowns were not argued for by most experts in any case.[43]
<p> Gregg Gonsalves, assistant professor of epidemiology at Yale University, described the strategy proposed by the declaration as &quot;culling the herd of the sick and disabled&quot;, calling it &quot;grotesque&quot;.[44] Arguing nearly half the American population is considered to have underlying risk factors for the infection, he advocated for the prevailing quarantine strategy, since peaks in infection rates among the young were likely to correlate with deaths of more vulnerable older people.[43] He wrote: &quot;If you&#x27;re going to turbo-charge community spread, as everyone else at &#x27;low-risk&#x27; goes about their business, I want the plan for my 86-year-old mother to be more than theoretical.&quot;[43]
<p> The Francis Crick Institute&#x27;s group leader of the cell biology of infection laboratory, Rupert Beale, said herd immunity is &quot;very unlikely&quot; to be built up before a COVID-19 vaccine is generally implemented.[45][34] Of the Great Barrington Declaration he said the &quot;declaration prioritises just one aspect of a sensible strategy – protecting the vulnerable – and suggests we can safely build up &#x27;herd immunity&#x27; in the rest of the population. This is wishful thinking. It is not possible to fully identify vulnerable individuals, and it is not possible to fully isolate them. Furthermore, we know that immunity to coronaviruses wanes over time, and re-infection is possible – so lasting protection of vulnerable individuals by establishing &#x27;herd immunity&#x27; is very unlikely to be achieved in the absence of a vaccine.&quot;[45][34] Beale described the declaration as &quot;not a helpful contribution to the debate&quot;.[34]
<p> Devi Sridhar, the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s professor of global public health, said that the declaration &quot;sounds good in theory&quot; but that &quot;if you actually work in practical public health on the front line, it doesn&#x27;t make much sense&quot;, saying the declaration&#x27;s premise was neither &quot;accurate&quot; nor &quot;scientific&quot;.[46] Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at University of Southampton, said the declaration was &quot;a very bad idea&quot; and doubted if vulnerable people could avoid the virus if it were allowed to spread.[26] He also said that &quot;ultimately, the Barrington Declaration is based on principles that are dangerous to national and global public health&quot;.[26] He said: &quot;There are countries who are managing the pandemic relatively well, including South Korea and New Zealand, and their strategies do not include simply letting the virus run wild whilst hoping that the asthmatic community and the elderly can find somewhere to hide for 12 months.&quot;[4][9] Associate professor at the University of Leeds&#x27;s School of Medicine Stephen Griffin criticized the declaration&#x27;s flaws in ethics, logistics, and science, pointing out the risk of long-term effects of infection in even those less vulnerable to severe infection.[47] He said: &quot;Ethically, history has taught us that the notion of segregating society, even perhaps with good initial intentions, usually ends in suffering.&quot;[48] Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, questioned whether herd immunity was possible for SARS-CoV-2: &quot;Natural, lasting, protective immunity to the disease would be needed, and we don&#x27;t know how effective or long-lasting people&#x27;s post-infection immunity will be.&quot;[47]Michael Osterholm, an American epidemiologist, regents professor, and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said that the Great Barrington Declaration was &quot;a dangerous mix of pixie dust and pseudoscience.&quot;[49]
<h> Name
<p> Town Hall of Great Barrington – the local government has criticized &quot;the declaration bearing the town&#x27;s name&quot;.[52]
<p> The board of selectmen and town manager of Great Barrington itself also criticized the declaration.[52] The local administration had &quot;no role in, or forewarning of, the declaration bearing the town&#x27;s name&quot;.[52] The town manager said: &quot;We are a COVID safe community, we are not tossing off our masks&quot;, accusing the declaration of having &quot;created harmful misperceptions&quot;, while the chair of the selectboard said: &quot;We are among the lowest risk towns in the state, and we hope to keep it that way&quot;.[52]
<h> Signatories&#x27; statements
<p> Matt Strauss, a physician and professor of Queen&#x27;s School of Medicine at Ontario&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston and one of the co-signatories, said that most medical professionals he had spoken to agree that current lockdown and isolation policies &quot;do more harm than good&quot;. He also said he thought his was not a minority opinion among his colleagues.[53]University of Montreal&#x27;s paediatrics and clinical ethics professor, Annie Janvier, a co-signatory and part of a group of Quebec scientists critical of the Government of Quebec&#x27;s response to the provincial epidemic, said that &quot;it&#x27;s not science that seems to be leading what&#x27;s going on with COVID, it&#x27;s public opinion and politics&quot;. She criticized the current lockdown measures in Canada saying that right now the vulnerable are not protected.[53]David Livermore, professor of medical microbiology at the University of East Anglia explained his decision to sign the declaration, saying that &quot;never in history have we handled a pandemic like this&quot; and that &quot;future generations will look back aghast&quot;.[54] Co-signatory Ellen Townsend, professor of psychology and leader of the self harm research group at the University of Nottingham, emphasised mental health concerns, stating that &quot;one policy decision that could have the most significant impact for young people to protect their mental health both now and in the future, would be to release them from the lockdown as soon as possible&quot;.[55]
<h> Trump administration support
<p> The Trump administration has been reported to support the Great Barrington Declaration, based on statements made to Newsweek and other publications by senior advisers that were not authorized to speak on the record.[56]
<p> On 5 October – the day after the date of the declaration – Gupta, Bhattacharya, and Kulldorff met the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, an appointee in the Cabinet of Donald Trump, and the neuroradiologistScott Atlas, an adviser to the Trump administration&#x27;s White House Coronavirus Task Force in Washington, D.C.[43] According to Azar, the meeting was held &quot;as part of our commitment to ensure we hear broad and diverse scientific perspectives&quot; and that &quot;we heard strong reinforcement of the Trump Administration&#x27;s strategy of aggressively protecting the vulnerable while opening schools and the workplace&quot; while according to Kulldorff &quot;we had a very good discussion. He asked many questions, and we put forth our case to protect the people who are vulnerable, and the idea of trying to do lockdowns to eliminate this disease is not realistic&quot;.[43] Afterwards Atlas also endorsed the declaration, telling The Hill that the &quot;targeted protection of the vulnerable and opening schools and society policy matches the policy of the President and what I have advised&quot;.[43] On the evening of the 5 October, Donald Trump returned to the White House after several nights in the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, having undergone treatments for coronavirus disease; he told his followers on social media on his return &quot;don&#x27;t be afraid of it [COVID-19]&quot;.[4][57]
<p> Bhattacharya denied that a herd immunity strategy was recommended by the declaration, saying &quot;a herd immunity strategy better describes the current lockdown policy&quot;, explaining &quot;herd immunity is a biological fact so of course we mention it, but it is not our strategy&quot;.[43] Gupta said that &quot;the alternative [to herd immunity], which is to keep suppressing the virus, comes at an enormous cost to the poor and to the young and not just in this country [the United States] but worldwide&quot;, arguing that the herd immunity threshold for SARS-CoV-2 will be reached in December 2020.[43] Bhattacharya advised that until that time vulnerable people might be housed away from multigenerational households, with government support, saying that &quot;we could do policies that would make those resources available to older people in multigenerational settings for the limited period of time that&#x27;s necessary until the disease is under control, and after time, they could go back home&quot;.[43]
<h> Other support
<p> In the UK, Conservative Partymember of parliament for Wycombe, Steve Baker, having signed the declaration, spoke in favour of the declaration&#x27;s policies on two occasions in the House of Commons, first on 6 October and again on 13 October.[59][60][61] Conservative MP for New Forest West, Desmond Swayne asked the Leader of the House of Commons if a debate could be held on what he called &quot;censorship&quot; and &quot;the sinister disappearance of the link from Google to the Great Barrington declaration&quot;.[62][63][39] Conservative journalist Toby Young wrote an opinion piece in The Spectator which supported the declaration and attacked the credentials of its critics, claiming they were &quot;censors&quot; and &quot;smear merchants&quot; while claiming the declaration&#x27;s authors were &quot;outliers or cranks&quot; but there had been a &quot;well-orchestrated attempt to suppress and discredit it&quot;.[64]

I want to take this argument head on, because on the substance, the Great Barrington declaration is underpinned by two central claims and both are emphatically false. First, it says that if enough people get covid, we will reach herd immunity. That is not true. Many infectious diseases never reach herd immunity, such as measles, malaria, AIDS and flu, and with increasing evidence of reinfection, we should have no confidence that we would ever reach herd immunity to covid, even if everyone caught it. Herd immunity is a flawed goal without a vaccine, even if we could get to it, which we cannot. The second central claim is that we can segregate the old and vulnerable on our way to herd immunity. That is simply not possible.Cite has empty unknown parameter: |column= (help)

No one can deny that it is well motivated. Indeed, it says: &quot;Keeping these measures&quot; — lockdown policies around the world — &quot;in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed.&quot; I have been looking closely at the critiques of the declaration. Professor James Naismith of the University of Oxford wrote: &quot;Humility and willingness to consider alternatives are hallmarks of good science.&quot; For the reasons that I have given, I am convinced that the Government must find an alternative strategic plan between the Great Barrington declaration and where we are today.

Friend is absolutely right to raise the question of censorship. The Government are sceptical about the Barrington declaration, but that does not mean that people should not be free to discuss it, and it is a worrying trend for large internet operators to think that they should be the arbiters of free speech. It is not for them to arbitrate over free speech. It is perhaps even more troubling that they are sometimes slow to take down material that could damage children, but they are not so slow to take down things that they do not agree with politically, and that raises important questions.
