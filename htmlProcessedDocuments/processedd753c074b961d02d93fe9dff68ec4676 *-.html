<p> Health Secretary Matt Hancock has denied claims he broke the government&#x27;s coronavirus drinking curfew by continuing to consume alcohol in the Commons bar after 10pm.
<p> A senior Tory MP told the Mail on Sunday that Mr Hancock remained in the Smoking Room bar until at least 10.25pm on Monday, despite House Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle insisting Commons venues must abide by the same curfew as all English pubs.
<p> The newspaper also reported Mr Hancock arrived at the bar just before a 9.40pm vote, ordered a glass of white wine and joked: &quot;The drinks are on me - but Public Health England are in charge of the payment methodology so I will not be paying anything.&quot;
<p> Mr Hancock&#x27;s alleged reference to Public Health England came after he had addressed the Commons regarding the controversy over the organisation misplacing nearly 16,000 coronavirus test results.
<p> &quot;The secretary of state then departed the parliamentary estate to go home.&quot;
<p> However, a government source told the PA news agency that Mr Hancock had made the joke as reported.
<p> The accusations come at a highly sensitive time for the government as mayors in northern England have expressed opposition to expected moves next week to shut down parts of the hospitality sector, such as pubs.
