<h> ICE agents stop Black man jogging in his own Boston neighborhood
<p> A Black man was stopped by ICE agents while he was jogging this week in his own Boston neighborhood.
<p> The jogger, Bena Apreala, recorded part of the incident on his cell phone. The short video, which shows at least three agents questioning him, was later uploaded to Facebook, prompting Boston authorities to call for an investigation.
<p> Apreala, a 29-year-old real estate agent, was jogging Tuesday morning in the West Roxbury neighborhood.
<p> He told the Boston radio station WBUR that the agents didn’t identify themselves when they approached him. He only realized who they were when he looked at their badges.
<p> “These guys just hopped out in full camouflage uniforms with masks over their face, and stopped me, and told me to immediately identify [myself],” he said. “I was confused as to whether or not they were even legitimate authority.”
<p> One of the agents can be heard asking if Apreala had any tattoos on his left or right arm “so we can confirm and we’ll be out of here.”
<p> “Am I free to go? Do I have to show you? If I’m free to go, then I’m not showing you anything,” he answered. “Thank you. Have a great day, guys.”
<p> As he walks away, Apreala speaks to the camera on his phone: “Man, did you see the feds tried to stop me?” he asked, incredulously. “ICE tried to stop me in my own neighborhood, bro.”
<p> A spokesperson for the Enforcement and Removal Operations, a division of ICE, told NBC News that agents did stop a jogger in a Boston neighborhood.
<p> “ICE officers were conducting surveillance as part of a targeted enforcement action&quot; in that neighborhood. They were looking for a &quot;previously deported Haitian national with multiple criminal convictions and pending cocaine and fentanyl trafficking charges that may have been residing in the area,” the organization said.
<p> Let me be clear: racial profiling and stops like these are wrong, unjustified, and will not be tolerated.
<p> &#x27;It was unacceptable in so many ways: violating someone’s rights just because of the color of their skin, is always unacceptable,” he tweeted Wednesday. “Also unacceptable is the fact that ICE hasn’t confirmed or denied that these were their agents.”
<p> Walsh said he’s “demanding that ICE stop this cruel practice of inciting fear in the lives of our residents, particularly our Black and Brown residents, and undocumented immigrants.”
<p> “Let me be clear: racial profiling and stops like these are wrong, unjustified, and will not be tolerated,” the mayor tweeted.
<p> U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter that she was calling for an “immediate investigation.”
<p> “For too long, ICE and CBP have acted with impunity — emboldened by a xenophobic Administration and the Occupant of this White House. We will not stand by and watch them intimidate, harass and racially profile our Black and Brown communities in Boston or anywhere in the country,” she wrote.
