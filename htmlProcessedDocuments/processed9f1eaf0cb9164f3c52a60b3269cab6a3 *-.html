<p> Anti-Netanyahu protests have been staged each Saturday since July to denounce the prime minister’s handling of the virus pandemic and the economy.
<p> In the latest demonstration, people waved Israeli flags and held up signs addressed to Netanyahu, whom many accuse of corruption, saying “Go away”, AFP reporters said.
<p> The demonstrators largely respected social distancing measures unlike in Tel Aviv where thousands took to the streets and clashed with police.
<p> “Police units at the scene are responding to the incidents and illegal protests,” he added.

<p> With more than 280,000 coronavirus infections confirmed so far and over 1,900 deaths in a population of nine million, Israel currently has the world’s highest weekly infection rate per capita.
<p> Public anger has also deepened in recent days in Israel over a bitterly unpopular lockdown after high-profile figures reportedly violated the restrictions, including Netanhayu’s wife Sara who summoned a hairdresser to the premier’s official residence.
<p> Only essential workers are allowed to leave their residences, adding further stress to an already battered economy, while Jews have been barred from gathering with friends and family over the High Holidays.

<h> ‘Each doctor wanted to touch a different part of my body’: Trump recalls COVID-19 struggle
<p> In a bizarre moment during his Michigan rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump told tales of his COVID-19 survival, and the doctors who he once claimed were terrific.
<p> Appearing before a crowded group, Trump recalled, &quot;I&#x27;m lying in bed, not feeling too great. And I&#x27;m looking up, and I see doctors out -- I just -- please will you just leave me alone. And each one of them wanted to touch a different part of my body. And I didn&#x27;t like that. I said, get the hell outa here, doctors!&quot;
<p> Trump confessed this week that his lungs were &quot;a little bit different,&quot; after having the coronavirus. His doctors have refused to release any information about the impact of the virus on Trump or his coronavirus testing timeline.
<h> Trump lies about reports of a ‘red wave’ — then touts nonexistent Michigan ‘man of the year’ award
<p> President Donald Trump ticked off several lies in just under 60 seconds while visiting his supporters in Michigan on Saturday.
<p> He told his supporters that the press was predicting an astounding &quot;red wave&quot; in November, a fact that even Fox News disputes, with their polls showing Biden leading nationally in the polls. Attacking them as &quot;the fake news media,&quot; Trump said even they were predicting a &quot;red wave&quot; saying that he was very far ahead in the early vote count.
<p> &quot;So, it just came out. We&#x27;re leading. What&#x27;s that?&quot; he asked as the crowd cheered. &quot;But let&#x27;s not talk about it.&quot;
<h> Trump laughs as Michigan rally chants ‘lock her up’ to governor the right-wing tried to kidnap and kill
<p> It&#x27;s been less than a month since the FBI thwarted a plot to kidnap and possibly kill Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), but President Donald Trump is still making fun of her.
<p> At his Saturday rally, he mocked her support of people wearing masks to help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The crowd began chanting, &quot;lock her up,&quot; a theme they often used when Trump brought up former Sec. Hillary Clinton.
<p> &quot;Lock her up, heh,&quot; Trump chuckled, allowing the chant to continue.
<p> It wasn&#x27;t just Whitmer who was at risk for an assassination attempt. The militia members also hoped to blow up the Michigan capitol, which would have killed hundreds of legislators, staffers, and workers from both sides of the aisle.
