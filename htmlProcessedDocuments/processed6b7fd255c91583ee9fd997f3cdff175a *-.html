<p> Desiree S. Anzalone, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz Sr.&#x27;s only great-granddaughter, has died at the age of 31.
<p> Desiree Anzalone, who was the daughter of Julia Arnaz and Mario Anzalone, died on Sept. 27 at Smilow Cancer Center in Connecticut after a battle with stage 4 breast cancer, PEOPLE confirmed. Her maternal grandfather was Desi Arnaz Jr., the son of the late &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; stars.
<p> Her mother, Julia Arnaz, told PEOPLE that her daughter died &quot;peacefully,&quot; but &quot;watching her slip away was just, I wouldn&#x27;t wish it on my worst enemy. No mother should have to watch that.&quot;
<p> The 31-year-old was first diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer at the age of 25 and underwent chemotherapy and had a double mastectomy. Her mother told PEOPLE that she learned two years ago the cancer had returned as stage 4 and spread to her liver, lungs and bones.
<p> Desiree was &quot;an old soul&quot; who loved 60s and 70s music and she was a &quot;talented photographer and enjoyed playing guitar with her father, singing and modeling photography,&quot; according to her obituary. &quot;Desiree was a lover of animals and people but most of all she loved life. She will be missed deeply by all but will live forever in our hearts.&quot;
