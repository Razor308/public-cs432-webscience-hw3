<p> It looks like the Dunk Low hype is set to continue on next year as we take a closer look at the upcoming Nike SB Dunk Low &quot;Summit White&quot;. Rumours of this colourway have been making rounds for quite some time now, but this is the first time that we actually get to see the shoe, and honestly, it&#x27;s everything we dreamed of and so much more.

<p> At this moment in time, it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint when exactly the Nike SB Dunk Low &quot;Summit White&quot; will launch, but it should hit shelves within the first half of 2021. Let us know what you think of this brand new colourway, and while you&#x27;re here, you might as well take your first look at the Frame Skate x Nike SB Dunk Low &quot;Habibi&quot;!
