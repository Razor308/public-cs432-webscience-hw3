<p> RICHMOND, Va. â€” An effort to end centuries of partisan gerrymandering in Virginia is up for consideration by the state&#x27;s voters.
<p> A referendum on the November ballot asks whether to amend the state Constitution to create a bipartisan panel that would take on the once-every-10-year task of redrawing the legislative boundaries for General Assembly and congressional districts.
<p> Some Democrats, though, are leading an effort to reject the referendum.
<p> They say the changes don&#x27;t do enough to remove legislators from the process.
<p> Republicans say Democrats have had a change of heart on the issue now that the Democrats control the state legislature and would be in position to draw the maps themselves in 2021.
