<p> Marleau began his NHL career with the Sharks as the No. 2 overall pick in 1997, and spent his first 19 seasons in San Jose. After leaving to play two years for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Marleau returned early in the 2019-20 season.
<p> A year ago today, Patrick Marleau returned to the #SJSharks, and at age 40 years, 25 days, became the oldest player to record a two-goal game in Chicago (for the Hawks or as an opponent) since Gordie Howe (51-225) did so on Nov. 11, 1979 with the Whalers. pic.twitter.com/wMXSvFGagw
<p> But after the Sharks fell out of contention early in the 2019-20 season, San Jose elected to try and help Marleau try to win his first Stanley Cup, trading him to the Pittsburgh Penguins for a third-round draft pick.
<p> As the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in games played, goals and points, Marleau&#x27;s return to the Sharks unquestionably will be a major boost to the San Jose locker room going into next season.
<p> He no longer is a first-line player, but Marleau finished last season with 11 goals and 11 assists, which was his 22nd consecutive year with double-digit goals. There&#x27;s no question he at least can be a contributor for this team.
<p> If Joe Thornton also elects to come back and play for the Sharks next season, the team will have two of the NHL&#x27;s most seasoned veterans on the roster, which only stands to benefit a squad that underperformed last season, but has the talent to be a playoff contender in the Pacific Division.
