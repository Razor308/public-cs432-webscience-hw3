<p> Insomniac&#x27;s original game, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, has been making headlines lately due to its confusing messaging around save data transfer and upgrade eligibility. Similar to Remedy Entertainment&#x27;s Control, Spider-Man: Remastered is not a free upgrade for PS4 owners. Players will have to buy the $70 Miles Morales Ultimate Edition if they want the enhanced Spider-Man: Remastered on PS5. Furthermore, save files will not transfer between systems.
<p> One of the biggest changes made in Spider-Man: Remastered is Peter Parker himself. Specifically, Insomniac choose to recast the face model for the game&#x27;s protagonist to better match actor Yuri Lowenthal&#x27;s facial capture. (And he looks a lot more like Tom Holland, too.)
<p> In other Spider-Man: Miles Morales news, a prequel artbook and novel are on the way for the game. Set just before the events of the expansion, the $16 novel &quot;Spider-Man: Miles Morales - Wings of Fury&quot; drops on November 10 and sees Miles battling Vulture and Starling. And in February 2021, the $40 artbook &quot;Spider-Man: Miles Morales - The Art of the Game&quot; will include concept art, renders, and commentary from the developers at Insomniac Games.
