<p> Activists are protesting the controversial arrest of a mentally ill man in Galveston.
<p> Video shows Neely was initially wearing a welding mask during the incident, which one of the officers removed.
<p> &quot;Especially being African-American. Not that we lived in that day and time, but we all studied. We know the history, and to think in 2019 they saw fit to treat him like they would have treated us back then, it&#x27;s just very disturbing,&quot; Christin Neely, Neely&#x27;s sister-in-law, told ABC13 in August.
<p> Neely, they say, despite their efforts, is homeless and mentally ill. They feel like the officers took advantage of him.
