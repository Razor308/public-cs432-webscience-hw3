<h> Now you can explore the plaza on a skateboard.
<p> Jumping around Delfino Plaza as Mario is one of the best parts of Super Mario Sunshine, and now you can explore the familiar locale on a skateboard. One player has recreated the best hub world in gaming as a skate park in Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2. This isn&#x27;t a mod, either--it&#x27;s been made in the game&#x27;s official park editor, so anyone can access and play it.
<p> Redditor and Super Mario Sunshine fan Gunderstank16 used the remake&#x27;s park creator to replicate the layout of Delfino Plaza. It doesn&#x27;t have the graphical charm of the original, but there are railings placed all around to help get over waterways and through tunnels. A tunnel system in the original version of Super Mario Sunshine makes it easier to get around key areas, and it&#x27;s also used on certain separate courses. There are a ton of places to grind on this map. However, you won&#x27;t be doing too many vert tricks.
<p> It&#x27;s missing some of the visual details from the original game, but it&#x27;s a very good recreation.
<p> It took them four days to finish the park and they have plans to work on more Mario-themed maps if this one garners enough interest from skaters. Delfino Plaza has been remade in other level creators, too--they include a take on the sunny locale in Halo&#x27;s map editor that a fan recreated a few years ago. That one has fewer kickflips.
<p> &quot;Playing through the newly remade levels is immensely enjoyable, and that on its own is enough to call Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2 a success,&quot; said Mat Paget in GameSpot&#x27;s Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 + 2 review. &quot;However, smart additions and an engaging challenge system make it an experience that&#x27;s more than just a brief skate through Tony Hawk&#x27;s past.&quot;
