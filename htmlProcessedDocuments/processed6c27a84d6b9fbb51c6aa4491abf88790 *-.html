<p> Alarm bells sound when you spot the life counter: 1000 lives to beat the game. Hit zero and it’s a total reset. And the danger’s confirmed the moment you press jump and feel what kind of acrobatics you’re lumped with. Prinny’s leap is arthritic. There’s no aftertouch to steer him in the air, beyond launching a second, rigid jump, forcing you to commit to every bound. Prinny’s no Mario. It’s more like a platformer starring a goomba. Not just mechanically, but thematically, too: Prinnies are the lowliest henchmen in the Disgaea series.

<p> Most deaths arise from Prinny’s limitations than any inventive level design. The knockback animation after taking a hit is our main cause of death, followed by an infuriatingly slow ledge climb and the hesitation before a butt stomp. None of it proves unworkable, but it does tap into a dustier part of the brain. The part raised on pixel-perfect leaps and learning level layouts by rote. At this point, it’s more of a dull memory test than an act of mechanical skill. A good choice for retro-heads longing for the days when games were broken instead of good.
<p> Combat’s largely the same in both games, with a knife attack that’s as fast as you can mash the button. You can create a blur of protective stabbing that keeps most demons at bay, or an aerial slash that weirdly shifts 2D levels to a 2.5D perspective. It lends the move impact, but you wish they’d do more with the perspective; maybe throw in some Klonoa-style level architecture. The damage of both is amplified by stunning goons with a butt stomp first, a dazed state that allows you to toss their bodies as projectiles. It’s crunchy enough fun.
<p> It gets uneven in a combo system. In Prinny 1, stringing together stomps fills a meter to earn a bonus health item or high scoring pudding. In our eyes, all puddings are high scoring, but that’s besides the point. What matters is that Prinny’s rigidity in the air means you can’t gracefully bop between heads, and the meter drops so fast it’s only really viable with specific enemy clusters. The system loosens up in Prinny 2, as every attack or item pickup fills the meter, giving it much needed momentum. A full meter also puts you in a powerful rage that fuels itself as you chew through enemies with sharper stabs and a damaging dash attack.

<p> Keeping that anger going gives Prinny 2 a jolt of arcade energy, but it undermines boss fights. These are a highlight of Prinny 1, as you stun attackers before doing any noticeable damage to their health bars. They are old school ‘learn the attack pattern’ numbers, but nicely done. The same goes for the sequel, but your rage moves can feasibly kick in and destroy a boss after the first stun. It may sound counterproductive to complain about platforming being too rough and chastising bosses for being too easy, but it really is a Goldilocks situation, never finding a balance that is quite right.
<p> In truth, you won’t even use 500 of those lives in either game. Ample checkpoints and Prinny’s ability to take three hits on default difficulty mean you can scrape through with careful play. A majority of deaths come on very specific stretches between checkpoints where one awkward jump throws you off, or a particularly nasty enemy – I’m looking at you Magma Fortress ninjas – give you the runaround. Prinny 2 drops hit points to two, but offers an easy mode with three and safety blocks, further easing those sticking points.
<p> Prinny’s generally cheap difficulty, and a wider lack of platforming imagination, are a shame as they try interesting structural things. The first six stages of both games are tackled in a choice of your order over the course of a day; the time you enter each stage changes its difficulty, layout and even the boss fight at the end. Pick the right level at the right time and you can give yourself an easier or harder ride, which feels like a fun riff on that classic Mega Man weapon hierarchy. It also means six variations on six stages, for replay value.

<p> But having tested them, there just aren’t enough interesting building blocks here to make those retreads stand out. Prinny 2 throws extra bits in the mix – background threats that attack the foreground and a few more vehicle sections than Prinny 1 – but it ends up feeling more hectic and unfair than exciting. Disappointing, as its bonus offerings are more padded out than Prinny 1’s, with an entirely separate campaign that plays like its own spin-off game. Even up against that juicy extra, Prinny 1 is still the better time: it has cleaner action, tighter boss fights and a mercifully panties-free storyline.
<p> The black mark against both games is the state of the ports. Apparently remastered from PSP, but hard to see how. The 3D levels are sharp enough, but the sprites and HUD elements are so hazy and washed out you’d think the original PSP assets had slipped in by mistake. It feels like one of those optometrist tests where half the wall chart looks blurry and the rest is in focus; acceptable in medical inspections, not ideal for home entertainment. The weird and knowing world of Disgaea is character-rich, but it’s woefully underserved by this rough tech treatment.
<p> If the duff port and repetitive grind aren’t enough to scare you off, it’s easier to recommend picking up Prinny 1 as a cheaper standalone. But it really is a case of all challenge and no charm. One thousand lives may sound like a godsend when you’re butting heads with a brick wall, but after two games of this, it begins to look like an eternity.
<h> Conclusion
<p> While it’s possible to get into the retro groove of Prinny’s perilous platforming, neither game does anything interesting enough to earn your patience. And collecting two games together only reveals how much of the same ground is covered by both. If anything, additions in the sequel water down the formula. If you simply must experience an unathletic penguin falling to its death again and again, stick with the simpler original. Or better yet, search for ‘penguin falling over’ on YouTube. Cheaper and a lot more entertaining.
<p> @Ryu_Niiyama Same here. The games play like the Ghouls ‘n Ghosts series of games and those faces are an aquired taste. I wonder if Matthew would score them as low as these games. If not, that&#x27;s not fair to the games.
<p> Getting this because I don&#x27;t have a PSP anymore but yeah the visuals are a big disappointment to me, right up until release I was hoping they were a work in progress but they barely look different from the PSP, a bit blurry which is a shame, I&#x27;m sure it looks better running in handheld though.
<p> I remember reading a comment on YouTube under a video for one of these about how the commenter’s dad beat the game and lost only 10 or so lives, to which the video uploader replied “yeah old people are really good at hard platformers”.
<p> Doesn&#x27;t sound like my type of game regardless of the score it got. I typically play more easy going games these days, with a focus on a good story/characters! There is actually a large audience out there that enjoys these types of games though, so I am glad they exist.
<p> @GumbyX84 I think the review makes it pretty clear that Prinny will appeal more to fans of certain games. But it simply isn&#x27;t as good as those earlier titles, too. Didn&#x27;t want to take the review down the route of &#x27;add 2 if you like x&#x27; as I trust the fine readers of NL to read the words and get a feel for where they stand on the issue.
<p> Looks OK, but when will somebody bring out TMNT in time remastered (again) or the original SNES version!! Oh and seeing Xmas is not too far off now, Daze before Xmas as well please?? Day 1 for both if they ever do!!
<p> From what I can see the &quot;soft&quot; look of the game indeed does not come so much from resolution of the rendering but from the low-res assets used in the hud, character sprites and textures on 3D objects. I would have expected at least that they&#x27;d update those with higher res versions but I have to agree, here it just looks ported straight up from the PSP, without any touch up at all. So little care on the developer&#x27;s part, and that&#x27;s so sad.
<p> To anyone basing their purchase decision on this review, please don&#x27;t. The first game especially is so much better than this review indicates. As someone who bought both of the originals for PSP, Prinny&#x27;s mechanics easily outweigh something akin to Ghouls &amp; Ghosts and the like, despite their very apparent nod towards them. And the soundtrack is incredible, probably the best I&#x27;ve ever heard in any 2D platformer.
<p> When it comes to this Switch port, I have to admit that the lack of effort they had with the graphics is disappointing. But if you can get past that, the first game offers an incredibly memorable platforming journey. The second game does tend to slip towards the more unfair end when it comes to challenge, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s still worth playing.
<p> I get why people say that games that use old, outdated mechanics, like knockback and rigid jumps, are inherently bad, but I personally don&#x27;t agree with it.
<p> I think that lots of people today miss the point that the controls are designed to compensate for the level design, and the real challenge of the game comes from getting around said level design with limited controls. I mean, look at the original Castlevania for NES: The stages were designed with lots of pits and other hazards in mind to capitalize on Simon&#x27;s limited controls.
<p> What this basically means is that you have to take your time and strategize what the best way to get around an enemy or obstacle is; you can&#x27;t just go barreling through the stage without any thought or course of action. On the flip side of the coin, though, once you know what to do, you can just blow through the section because, again, the difficulty is in the stage design, not in something like RNG.
<p> Also, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of comments for it, but I would advise people not to judge a game by what a review website tells them. More often than not, critics are harder on games than they really should be because the product isn&#x27;t the next Mario of the generation or something like that.
<p> Still have the psp games. It doesn&#x27;t surprise me some people think the controls suck. The fact is you have no air control and it tries to be an elitist platformer like that. It&#x27;s more a measure of making you do your jumps perfectly more than bad controls. You just have to take your time and get used to it and you see what they were going for.
<p> I&#x27;m sure they are fine here as well but I&#x27;ll just stick to my psp copies.
<p> I preordered the special edition not really knowing what to expect, I’m collecting Disgaea limited editions and thought this relates. Casp O’Saurus did a fantastic job of making a case for these games. To be honest from what I’ve seen it looks like a 5 if you’re not particularly into the genre going up to a 7 or 8 if you love old-school platformers.
<p> If you aren’t sure whether to go for it or not, NISA are never far away from a financial crisis. They offer games we otherwise would never see in the west so please do support them if you can.
<p> @BadlyDrawnDedede it is definitely one of those games people go and say it&#x27;s not hard, then someone tries and thinks that person is a total jerk.
<p> The boss fights especially are more about learning what to do more than the actual execution being intricate. When the first game came out I rage quit it but picked it up again after a few months and realized I wasn&#x27;t being a wimp for going slow, you literally had to go slow.
