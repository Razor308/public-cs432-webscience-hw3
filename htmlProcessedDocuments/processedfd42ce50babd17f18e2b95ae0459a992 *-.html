<h> Ad for onions removed by Facebook for being &#x27;overtly sexual&#x27;
<p> The Seed Company by E.W. Gaze posted a photo of onion seeds for sale late last month on Facebook.
<p> However, soon after publishing the seemingly innocuous post, which advertised “Onion, Walla Walla Sweet” seeds for $1.99, the company got a notification from the social media giant declaring the photo of the vegetable was “overtly sexual” and had to be removed.
<p> “So we just got notified by Facebook that the photo used for our Walla Walla Onion seed is ‘Overtly Sexual’ and therefore cannot be advertised to be sold on their platform... Can you see it?” the company cheekily wrote.
<p> The notice informed the company that “listings may not position products or services in a sexually suggestive manner.”
<p> Store manager Jackson McLean told BBC he felt it might have something to do with “the round shapes” of the onions that flagged Facebook.
