<p> NSW One Nation leader Mark Latham says Premier Daniel Andrews turned “beetroot red” with embarrassment and humiliation when Sky News host Peta Credlin grilled him on missing hotel quarantine phone records.
Ms Credlin on Friday probed Premier Andrews on why key phone records which are able to prove who decided to use private security were not tendered to the hotel quarantine inquiry.
“We should see the phone log of the premier and the head of his department as you were magnificently pointing out today at the press conference,” Mr Latham told Sky News host Peta Credlin.
“This bloke (Andrews) should resign, he’s a disgrace to his party, he’s a disgrace to his state, he’s a disgrace to our country and anyone who’s got a shred of honesty in their body.”
Mr Latham said Premier Andrews turned “beetroot red with embarrassment and humiliation” when asked by Ms Credlin about the missing phone records.
“And so he should, because he’s an habitual liar, he’s covered up, he knows the truth of this because he announced it,” he said.
