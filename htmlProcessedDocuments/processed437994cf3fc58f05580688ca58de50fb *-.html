<h> Bungie: Weâ€™re Trying to Get Destiny 2 to Feel Like Destiny 1, But Updated to the Systems We Have Now
<p> Bungie is closing in on the release of the third major Destiny 2 expansion, Beyond Light. Originally scheduled for September 22nd, it was delayed to November 10th, which is also the same date of the global Xbox Series S and X launch.
<p> Luke Smith, Destiny 2 Game Director at Bungie, was featured in the latest EDGE magazine (December 2020, issue 351). There, he discussed the benefits of introducing the new Darkness-based Stasis powers in Destiny 2 Beyond Light.
<p> What we&#x27;re trying to do with Stasis and wielding the Darkness is to show you as a player more freedom. There&#x27;s also a meta statement tha we&#x27;re making about the difference in the powers between light and dark, but there&#x27;s this other part, which is the fantasy of, &#x27;This is my Guardian, there are many like it, but this one is mine&#x27;.
<p> I think we&#x27;re trying to get a little bit back to the feeling of Destiny 1, but updated to how we&#x27;re thinking and some of the systems that we&#x27;re using today in Destiny 2.
<p> I&#x27;ll use a MOBA as an example. They get to have a lot of tuning vectors for their four abilities. The modularity and the piecemeal nature of Statis allows us more flexibility to do more to introduce....There&#x27;s cool stuff. I know that Kevin Yanes and the abilities team have a pretty strong desire to keep iterating on it. We&#x27;re just getting started.
<p> Beyond Light will also shelve some rather large pieces of Destiny 2 content into the Content Vault, as the developers have decided that such a bold move is required in order to make the game feel truly changing over time. That said, Smith doesn&#x27;t pretend to ever get the content balance perfectly right, mostly due to the huge diversity of the player base.
<p> I don&#x27;t know that we&#x27;ll ever really feel like we have the balance totally right, because of the diversity of our player base. You know, we don&#x27;t have a canonical Destiny 2 player. I mean, we have data that speculates what they&#x27;re like, but even that data says that these players are unlike any of a game we&#x27;ve ever seen.
<p> I could hear someone saying, &#x27;Hey, this year felt really good&#x27;. And I could open a tab and bump into 55 people talking about how this year stank. You&#x27;re like, &#x27;Oh shit, this is where things might be heading. We&#x27;ve got to keep up with this&#x27;. But the truth of working on Destiny is that there&#x27;s always something changing your plans. It&#x27;s the embodiment of best-laid plans, right? A lot of times it doesn&#x27;t matter what we believe, what our strategy was, because it&#x27;s about the team executing to the highest level that they can with the time we have.
