<p> Shamed former SNP politician Margaret Ferrier has vowed to keep her £80,000-per-year MP job despite widespread fury over an astonishing breach of coronations rules that saw her travel 800 miles across Britain while infected, claiming it was a &#x27;blip&#x27;.
<p> The brazen politician, 60, blamed &#x27;muddled&#x27; rules after admitting she travelled from her Rutherglen constituency in Scotland to Parliament in London - and then back again - by train while suffering from Covid.
<p> She was stripped of the SNP whip amid calls for her to quit the Commons completely for putting people&#x27;s lives at risk.
<p> But last night she insisted she would not stand down and trigger a by-election, claiming Covid &#x27;makes you act out of character&#x27;.
<p> Scotland Yard previously confirmed that it was investigating the MP over alleged breaches of coronavirus laws designed to prevent those infected from passing it on to others.
<p> Ms Ferrier told The Sun on Sunday that she had &#x27;panicked&#x27; but remained adamant that she had followed the rules correctly.
<p> Speaking of the backlash, she said: &#x27;You feel you&#x27;re getting a lot of criticism from people you thought were your colleagues or friends who would understand it was one blip.&#x27;
<p> But her attitude was branded &#x27;exceptionally arrogant&#x27; by Tory MSP Annie Wells, who said: &#x27;She put lives at risk. Time to go.&#x27;
<p> First Minister Nicola Sturgeon this morning repeated her call for Ms Ferrier to quit.
<p> Confirming steps were also being taken that could see Ms Ferrier also stripped of her SNP membership, the party leader said: &#x27;I have read the comments in the media today and I still hope that she will do the right thing.&#x27;
<p> SNP Margaret Ferrier has brushed off her 800-mile round trip to Parliament with coronavirus symptoms as a &#x27;blip&#x27; and has instead blamed the &#x27;muddled&#x27; rules
<p> She added: &#x27;We suspended her from party membership, we now have a due process we&#x27;ve got to go through.
<p> &#x27;I can&#x27;t unilaterally decide to expel somebody, we have a process and the SNP in that process will take its course, we&#x27;ve done everything in terms of SNP membership that we&#x27;re able to do at this stage.
<p> &#x27;No party leader has the power to make an MP resign from Parliament but I couldn&#x27;t be clearer, she should step down from Parliament, the lapse of judgment in travelling hundreds of miles knowing she had tested positive for Covid was so significant and so unacceptable that I don&#x27;t think there is any other acceptable course of action for her.&#x27;
<p> Ms Ferrier travelled by train to London from Scotland while awaiting the results of a Covid test at the end of last month and then travelled back the following day after being told the test was positive.
<p> Images on her Twitter page showed her in several public places likely to have been busy on a Saturday, including the Vanilla Salon and South Lanarkshire Eastfield Lifestyle leisure centre in Rutherglen, and Sweet P gift shop in Burnside.
<p> Ms Ferrier said: &#x27;A lot of people say Covid makes you do things out of character. You&#x27;re not thinking straight.
<p> &#x27;At that moment, when I thought it would come back negative and it was positive, I was utterly shocked. You could have knocked me over...

<p> Ms Ferrier, 60, (pictured with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon) is yet to resign from the Commons despite being stripped of the SNP whip amid calls for her to quit for putting people&#x27;s lives at risk
<p> &#x27;It may be a serious error of judgment. I&#x27;m not denying that. People may be saying, &#x27;You should have known better, you&#x27;re a public figure&#x27; - but at the end of the day it still hurts. You then think is all that hard work and dedication just wiped away?&#x27;
<p> Ms Ferrier went on to say that the regulations &#x27;have changed and have been so muddled&#x27; in recent months.
<p> She also slammed critics who have likened her to Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minister&#x27;s aide, who travelled 260 miles to be near relatives at the height of the pandemic.
<p> Ms Ferrier could face a £4,000 fine for a first-time offence of &#x27;recklessly&#x27; coming into contact with others when she should have been self-isolating under a law that came into force on the day of her positive test.
<p> Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said earlier this week that he was &#x27;surprised, amazed and shocked&#x27; that Ms Ferrier has not yet resigned.
<p> He told Sky News&#x27; Sophy Ridge On Sunday her actions were &#x27;irresponsible and dangerous&#x27;.
<p> Meanwhile, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has recently been under pressure to sign up to a recall petition that could force Ms Ferrier out of her job.
<p> Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has said Ms Sturgeon must support the move which could be triggered if she is suspended from the Commons for two weeks.
<p> Under parliamentary rules, the MP would face a by-election if at least 10 per cent of her 81,000 constituents signed.
<p> Ms Sturgeon used a series of expletives and said her &#x27;head was in her hands&#x27; on being told that her &#x27;friend and colleague&#x27; had broken the law, sources told the Times.
<p> The Scottish First Minister also referred to Margaret Ferrier as &#x27;Margaret Covid&#x27; in a blunder during press conference on Friday as she discussed when she first knew Ms Ferrier had flouted coronavirus restrictions.
<p> She said at the time: &#x27;The first I knew about Margaret Covid, er, Margaret Ferrier having Covid was yesterday afternoon. I think people can imagine my reaction to hearing that.&#x27;
<p> However, Ms Sturgeon had previously made exactly the same gaffe, stating: &#x27;Patrick Grady and the SNP didn&#x27;t know last Monday or Tuesday that Margaret Covid had suspected or then confirmed Covid.&#x27;
