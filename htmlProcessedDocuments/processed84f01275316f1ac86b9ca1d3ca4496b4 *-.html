<h> Teenager killed, two others injured, in Campostella Road shooting
<p> NORFOLK, Va. (WAVY) — Norfolk Police say one of three teenagers injured Thursday night in a shooting on Campostella Road has died.
<p> Dispatchers say the incident was in the 400 block of Campostella Road. It was reported at 8:06 p.m.
<p> Officers arrived on scene to find three teenagers who had been shot.
<p> One of the victims, a 16-year-old, died from his injuries at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, police confirmed Friday morning.
<p> The other two teens, a 15-year-old male and a 14-year-old male, were treated for non life-threatening injures.
<p> Around 5:30 p.m. Friday, Norfolk Police said they were still looking for the people behind the shooting.
<p> “Our detectives have been working non-stop since this this shooting occurred. We will not stop until we arrest the individuals that are responsible for the murder and shooting of all these young men,” Sgt. William Pickering said.
<p> 10 On Your Side spoke to two neighbors who don’t want to be identified.
<p> Another neighbor lives in an apartment that overlooks the scene where the teens fell.
<p> “I was on my patio with my daughter. I heard one shot, then 10 seconds later, I heard maybe 30 shots,” he said.
<p> The second neighbor lives in the new Retreat at Harbor Pointe, and says he will never forget what he heard Thursday night, but it played out right in front of him four floors down on Campostella.
<p> “And then I saw a young guy running and looking at me.”
<p> He says the guy was running away from where the other three had been shot, and he usually saw him with three other guys.
<p> “When the shots rang out, I saw him running … on the side of my building … there were usually four of them, and I was wondering what if the other three got shot… He ran behind a building … he was ripping off his shirt back there,” he said pointing to a house behind the strip shopping center.
<p> The guy then came back toward the scene and disappeared.
<p> The man and a woman that live there both report teens often hang out in the apartment complex and on the stairs near their apartments. It’s apparently been a problem, and police have been called.
<p> Here’s the bottom line for the woman and her children: “I have been here for a month now, and I can’t wait until the lease is up, and I’m going to leave.”
<p> 10 On Your Side has been told police have taken and seen surveillance video.
<p> Anyone with information is asked to call the Crime Line at 1-888-LOCK-U-UP (1-888-562-5887) or submit a tip online.
