<p> The White House had no immediate comment on further details about the call.
<p> China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, in late 2018 and later charged them with espionage, after Canada had arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies , on a U.S. warrant.
<p> The relations between Canada and China have since been tense.
<p> The United States’ own tensions with China have also increased recently over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak, the ongoing trade war between the two countries, China’s imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong and the subsequent end to Hong Kong’s special status under U.S. law by Trump.
<p> Trudeau and Trump also discussed on Saturday the U.S. president’s health following his recent COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as ongoing efforts to manage the coronavirus.
