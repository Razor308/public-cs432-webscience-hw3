<p> So, what does it means for the future of Indivisible? A statement from its publisher 505 Games reveals there will be no more production on the game. Guest characters and Backer characters will also no longer be added to the game.
<p> On the Switch front, there&#x27;ll be one more update to put this version in line with other platforms:
<p> There is an update for Nintendo Switch that is already in submission. It will add Razmi’s Challenges, New Game+ and Couch Co-Op to the Nintendo Switch. That update will bring all platforms to the same level of development and offer a complete game experience to all current and future players. This is expected to release later this month starting on October 13 and rolling out to other regions afterwards.
<p> 505 is also expecting a &quot;small batch&quot; of North American physical Switch cartridges to be made available at select retailers in November and will share more information about this soon.
<p> When he’s not paying off a loan to Tom Nook, Liam likes to report on the latest Nintendo news and admire his library of video games. His favourite Nintendo character used to be a guitar-playing dog, but nowadays he prefers to hang out with Judd the cat.
<p> Really sad thay this game has to suffer because of everything that happened. Especially when the games artists have now come forward and said that all of the artwork, animations, and visual assets are complete for the 15 extra/crossover characters. All that needed to be done was program the characters
<p> At least Lab Zero didnt have control over Skullgirls and they are planning on supporting it with a new character next year
<p> Sad to see, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that Lab Zero is totally dead. The company, yes, but the entire team just went and formed Future Club without Mike Z&#x27;s toxic presence. So it&#x27;s the same studio, they just changed names and kicked out the jerk.
<p> This is sad, since this is all because of that on jacka** Mike guy who had to do some stupid things (I don&#x27;t remember what, but it wasn&#x27;t good), So I give my good luck to everyone in the team that isn&#x27;t named Mike Zaimont.
<p> Too bad, but at least the game itself is well and released. And firmly on my wishlist, needless to say.
<p> @Fath I&#x27;m skeptical about crowdfunding in general. The hydra of entitled audience whims is enough of a rectal ache even when they have no right to dictate the production; when they become a collective crowd of effective producers/sponsors... YIKES. Finding a publisher - no matter how corporate or trend-fallible - at least should give the creators a smaller number of backseat drivers to listen to.
<p> Awful for the backers, but I&#x27;m glad the devs are free of their boss&#x27;s BS. Hopefully 505 can shift the rights over to the new studio and give this game the proper sendoff it deserves... without Mike Z&#x27;s involvement, of course.
<p> @Facelord As much as I hate forcing American ideas of “diversity” into everything, regardless of the culture of origin, this case ain’t it mate. Lab Zero seems to have been cursed back when they were doing sexy fighting games.
<p> I remember the demo version seemed to be on the Playstation store for years before ever being released. When you spend so much time and all of your funds making a game unless it sells really well fast you are probably going to be in trouble financially at some point.
<p> @Arckadius I know what you mean. I know I&#x27;ll get my money back if it doesn&#x27;t release, but I was still hoping for the physical U.S. copy.
<p> On another note, wasn&#x27;t 505 the same company that botched the port of &quot;Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&quot; on the Switch originally? I still loved the game and 100%&#x27;d it in the Switch upon it&#x27;s release, but I admit this was a poor porting job. Very noticeable difference when I went back and played it on the PC.
