<p> Updated: Physical video game manuals are seemingly no longer a thing - even Super Mario 3D All-Stars didn&#x27;t include one.
<p> To help fill the void, one fan has taken it upon themselves to create their very own hand-made manual for the game. Here&#x27;s how they describe it:
<p> &quot;This will complete the physical set as well as give new and older gamers the feel of the retro days where manuals were used to help, as well look great. This is not an official product nor meant to be, it is made by myself to give a complete physical feel with the official game.&quot;
<p> The manual includes a total of 44 pages, covers all three games in the collection, and features important details like the prologue and controls of each title. There&#x27;s also a star list - ensuring no objectives are skipped.
<p> When he‚Äôs not paying off a loan to Tom Nook, Liam likes to report on the latest Nintendo news and admire his library of video games. His favourite Nintendo character used to be a guitar-playing dog, but nowadays he prefers to hang out with Judd the cat.
<p> 12 quid?! (10.80 is the &quot;sale&quot; price) Jeez. I&#x27;m surprised that publishers hadn&#x27;t given up on physical manuals sooner.
<p> We truly were spoiled with DS games. No patches. No DLC. Mandatory manuals for EVERY game (some in colour). Health and safety manuals for EVERY game. An additional Wi-Fi manual if the game supported online play. A Club Nintendo card for Nintendo-published games. And the odd promotional flyer with some games. It was almost like the software was merely an afterthought for the amount of paper we got with our games.
<p> Yeah pretty much majority of Etsy is a breeding ground for copyright and trademark infringement. Many sellers are shut down often by Disney, Professional sports leagues and teams, movie studios etc. But they&#x27;re like a hydra dragon. You cut one head off and another (sometimes 2) comes back. I feel like companies are aware of it and only take action when they notice the seller is making more than the average garage sale and/or sell something that could taint the brand (example would be Mickey Mouse getting blown by Minnie T-Shirt or a Mario themed bong. I&#x27;ve seen stuff like that).
<p> @link3710 We‚Äôll that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs right to make money using official Nintendo images and logos without the consent of the owners of said properties. Now I won‚Äôt take away from how amazing this looks. I love it but it doesn‚Äôt make it right. Also I don‚Äôt want to start a debate on a gaming website. So happy gaming bro üòé
<p> @Chibi_Manny they are the people who are ok to be charged still around 60$ or Euro for a game that doesn&#x27;t come even with a booklet. It doesn&#x27;t justify the price tage since they don&#x27;t have to pay more money to sell their games. The price cut should&#x27;ve been there already for leaving a booklet alone. Still they charge the customer. Customers are here faulty IMO. because they do accept it. Period
<p> @Rhaoulos Yup. It&#x27;s considered fair use, so long as the product as a whole is both transformative and consists of &quot;criticism, commentary, or news reporting&quot;. It&#x27;s the same reason this site has images of Nintendo logos all over the place and it&#x27;s totally legal.
<p> Just got a arms booklet from the guy who made the splatoon 2 one. He gives them out for free on Twitter though. It looks really good, and I‚Äôve been following the dude that makes these and I want his botw one.
<p> This is really cool, despite being illegal to sell, if it were just a file one could download for free it would be OK I think.
<p> I&#x27;ve always loved the manuals that come in color with character art and profiles, I have a lot of GBA ones, the FE one is great because it made some minor characters like L&#x27;Arachel and Joshua seem important from the get-go. It also has a map of the continent.
<p> I notice it&#x27;s only on this website you get people furiously defending Nintendo if someone dares to make an unofficial product/rom of one of their products- no offense but most normal people on other gaming websites dont ever tend to pay that sort of thing much mind, laughable really. Fair enough most of this stuff isnt 100% legal but then again Nintendo (&amp; probably some of you complaing) are often no angels in that regard neither. Leaving myself open for the &quot;ok Boomer&quot; comments I know but back when they used to show those &quot;you wouldn&#x27;t steal a car&quot; antipiracy trailers before every vhs movie &amp; &quot;dont copy that floppy&quot; was still new people used to mock those things- when the hell did people start defending these big wealthy companies so vigorously as if they had a stake in Nintendo themsevles?
<p> @abdias@link3710 I had no idea images could be used freely in specific cases. Thanks a lot for the explanation. I know it&#x27;s unrelated, but it still feels like a complete ripoff at a 25% the price of a game.
<p> I really wish printed manuals would be regular with physical games again. I love reading a crispy printed manual before I start a new game for the first time. Esp. nice when there is a little back story within the manual.
<p> @RasandeRose Welcome to the digital era. They are trying to push digital more and more at an ever higher price. Just look at the new gen consoles coming up with digital only versions. Cutting costs with zero advantage whatsoever for the clients.
<p> So, for NL physical video game manuals are &quot;no longer a thing&quot;. Maybe CD Projekt Red wasn&#x27;t informed about this, as not only the Witcher 3 includes a compendium, but also stickers and a poster. And they didn&#x27;t even release it on an anniversary.
<p> @fusermarucs I&#x27;m more dismayed to know that the physical edition does not include any booklet at all, than interested in wondering why this one is advertised here.
<p> It&#x27;s highlighting the question of why we&#x27;re getting half of a physical product with the official release? Finding a tiny cart in a big, otherwise empty, plastic case is ridiculous - and the fact the cases are the size for a manual is cruelly rubbing salt in the wound. It&#x27;s just another modern-company con ‚Äì that and digital copies costing the same despite the lower overheads. Our favourite companies are taking us for a ride people, and we don&#x27;t seem to be putting up much of a fight.
<p> The game really should have came with an artbook or something inside the case. It&#x27;s nice to have all three of these games on the Switch in one collection but man, the overall package was pretty standard for a &quot;celebration&quot;. Still enjoyed it though.
<p> I like instruction manuals, but honestly, I don&#x27;t really miss them much. Modern games usually tell you how to play. What drives me crazy is when ports of much older games (not to be confused with remakes) don&#x27;t even have digital instructions. That&#x27;s my gripe with the NES &amp; SNES games on Nintendo Switch. It&#x27;s not everyone has played all those games before. Even the Wii and 3DS Virtual Consoles had them. Oh well. At least there&#x27;s GameFAQs ... most of the time.
<p> I remember the first time I bought a game that didnt come with a manual..... I thought ‚Äúwhat the hell is this, why is the case so light?‚Äù Kind of sucks that its gotten to this point, they could at least put the manuals in the game itself some where instead of on a web page.
<p> @Rhaoulos Contrary to what others are stating here, at least in the US, you unequivocally CANNOT use the intellectual property of a company (e.g., Nintendo) in a product you are selling unless you have licensed said intellectual property from that company. It does not matter if the purpose is &quot;informational&quot; or not; if you are selling it, you cannot use it without a license. For those of you that remember the unofficial game guides of the 90s-early 2000s, they often used gaudy illustrations that closely resembled the game&#x27;s art assets but were different enough to prevent a cease and desist. The same concept applies today; this person on Etsy could make guides to sell all day long using their own illustrations and text, but the moment they decided to use Nintendo&#x27;s art assets, they crossed the legal line.
<p> @fusermarucs I have been making this exact same point for almost a year only to be ignored at best and insulted at worst by Nintendo Life&#x27;s staff and readers. Etsy is willfully bad at policing intellectual property abuse among its users. Wait until the holidays roll around for Nintendo Life to start pushing Etsy merch that utilizes Nintendo&#x27;s intellectual property because Nintendo Life gets a percentage back of clickthrough Etsy sales. It is illegal and morally reprehensible for a company like Nintendo Life, who already gets review copies and special press access from Nintendo, to push unlicensed merchandise when there is plenty of licensed merchandise to promote. @antdickens , do you have a defense for Nintendo Life hawking and making money from Etsy sellers that steal intellectual property for profit?
<p> As a collector I love it I think the games should all come with manuals still it&#x27;s kinda ridiculous that they don&#x27;t imo. Don&#x27;t come at me with all this global warming paper nonsense either these are video games not junk mail.
<p> People on here with their moral bu11s.h.i t argument act like they&#x27;re goddang saints or something. If I want to buy this manual I&#x27;m going to do it. I don&#x27;t need to since I own the original games and they&#x27;re much better than this sloppy port. But don&#x27;t come on an internet message board with your stupid videogame morality arguments. Get your a.s.s to church and let us have fun
<p> @Mattiac You also had to realize that manual are also called instruction booklet therefore they basically serve the same purpose as tutorials in-game. A majority of modern games nowadays had in-game mandatory or optional tutorials/training modes to help guide players within the game. Because of this there&#x27;s no need for manuals as the game basically already teaches the player how or what to do when playing the game. The reason why a lot of the older games had manuals was not because they are part of the physical package but because they serve as a guide to teach the player about the game before they play as a lot of older games doesn&#x27;t had in-game tutorials.
<p> @DrDaisy Some of the Japan only SNES Online games like Mario Picross and Panel De Pon haven&#x27;t even been translated to English. :-/ I mean it&#x27;s nice we&#x27;re getting them but how long would it take Nintendo to translate the small amount of text those games have in the menus etc?
<p> I&#x27;ve downloaded the original manuals, but would have been nice to see updated ones if they were a free download! I miss manuals as well because if you&#x27;re playing a lot of games of playing infrequently, it&#x27;s nice to be able to look back at the instructions...
<p> @NPC411 I‚Äôve not noticed the Etsy links b4 but I‚Äôll be looking out for them from now: I was genuinely surprised to see it on NL as I generally feel this is a nicely run website.I agree that Nintendo should have done a manual - doesn‚Äôt make it right that someone else does it and charges ¬£11 for it.
<p> @Papichulo Again, it‚Äôs not so much that it is available- my original point was that I was surprised NL was promoting it. And what exactly is wrong about standing up in a small way to someone making money off the back of someone else‚Äôs work?
<p> IP warriors that barely grasp the law and repeat the same dull ‚Äúmaking money off someone else work‚Äù sound bites in every thread should be instabanned they ruin this site.
<p> The work here was done by the individual selling. It‚Äôs the same as switch player magazine or any other such publication.
<p> To print on high quality paper is expensive small scale. To print a million copies would have cost Nintendo next to nothing but here we are.
<p> Etsy have some great little sellers. Clearly this person has a passion for this. A lot of hard work went in. Same as though hand drawn guides (I got the Zelda one through psychically the other week and it‚Äôs gorgeous) A pdf version might have been nice to share (like Hans drawn guide fella does) but I don‚Äôt begrudge them charging this. It‚Äôs entitled to expect it free. Nintendo are losing ZERO money from this and it is not damaging their products at all.
<p> Neither are the dock socks, game cases or all the other bits. It‚Äôs part of a rich world that makes gaming better.
<p> So please either wait ten years to post and mature a bit or get a grip on reality. We don‚Äôt need to have you preach in every thread - we all know it falls in a grey area but if you think this little guide is a big crime you wait until you hear about child abuse, rape and genocide.... honestly the word is a dark dark place and this little guide is a little ray of light so calm down....
<p> @NPC411 I have always found a bit shady how NL promotes that kind of stuff. Sure they need the ad money but there are much better solutions, like quality articles, or at least adding a disclaimer on IP violation.
<p> They are always really aggressive defending emulation, saying it is not illegal to reverse engineer a system, but when the only goal is to play pirated games, you know there is a problem.
<p> @Stocksy mature a bit? Child abuse? Rape??? Why on earth are you bringing all that into an otherwise civilised discussion about IP?? Did a bee end up in your cornflakes this morning??
<p> There are always worse things going on somewhere than whatever is being discussed here on a video game website - that isn‚Äôt the issue. Nobody here is ‚Äòmorally crusading‚Äô either from what I can see.
It is a valid point that the Etsy seller - undoubtedly like many others Etsy sellers - is profiting off Nintendo‚Äôs IP without their permission, and that it looks like NL is promoting the work for whatever reason.
I‚Äôm sure IP law will back me up here as would Nintendo‚Äôs lawyers.
That‚Äôs all. Nobody is claiming it is the end of the world, or that is a worse issue than coronavirus and all the other nightmares going on right now!!
<p> On the one hand, using anyone&#x27;s IP without permission breaches regulation, and doing so for commercial gain invites repercussions from the IP owner.
<p> That said, the producer of these manuals isn&#x27;t passing off by pretending to be Nintendo, nor are they taking revenue from Nintendo, as Nintendo does not offer these manuals either included with a game or separately, nor as I see it are they devaluing the brand as it looks to be a quality creation.
<p> In my view a fair reading is it is a fan contribution to the community, with the producer covering time and materials costs of production - yes we could argue all day about what is a reasonable amount to cover costs but ¬£11 doesn&#x27;t seem ridiculous to me once you take the Etsy fee and other costs. I guess the producer might still acknowledge Nintendo&#x27;s copyright without having express permission to reproduce it - maybe they do.
<p> Personally, I regret the loss of manuals. I found it a nice part of the experience. I&#x27;m old enough to remember boxed PC games with big manuals, sometimes in the form of a novella (like the X-Wing series), really added to the experience and the immersion.
<p> So my view is more power to these producers for creating something, with care, that the games companies will not. Whether that&#x27;s worth ¬£11 to someone is their choice.
<p> I don‚Äôt think this is necessarily illegal.It‚Äôs like writing fan fiction, no?And I think it‚Äôs awesome and would pay for it if I actually owned the game. The irony there is that I didn‚Äôt buy it because if the lack of anything extra (such as a manual) with the cart.
<p> Streets of Rage 4 and Wargroove both came with manuals (if I recall correctly)... so when it‚Äôs a well done package with care taken, it‚Äôs obviously ‚Äúpossible‚Äù to do.
<p> From what I can tell from the pictures on Etsy, the booklets are well made with attention to detail. The seller wanted to make instruction bookets to compliment their game collection, and has given other people the option to buy their own copy. Not everyone wants a physical manual, but clearly some people do. Where Nintendo (and many others) have failed to provide one, I see no harm in a fan making a quality product to fulfil that demand.
<p> I take no issue with someone creating this, just as I have no issue with people who have made game card cases in the shape of a Mario &#x27;?&#x27; block (I had one for my 3DS games), or other unofficial accessories, so long as they&#x27;re good quality.
<p> Value price-wise, that will depend on how much someone wants it for their collection. I haven&#x27;t bought Mario 3D All Stars, but with all the hype around the anouncement and the Limited Edition/time nature of the release, I was surprised it didn&#x27;t come with a booklet. The first Super Mario All-Stars did (okay, at the time all SNES games did). Creating one for the 3D collection would have been a nice touch.
<p> Most of my games tend to be digital these days, partly through laziness of swapping out game cards. The only physical Switch game I have is Link&#x27;s Awakening, which came with my Lite (along with a poster and a keyring). This Etsy seller has made a manual for that game, so I&#x27;ve treated myself to one.
<p> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s worth the price and will be nice to have something official looking in the case - what else are those little clips going to be used for?
<p> This may even encourage me to buy another physical game just so I have a reason to put the Link&#x27;s Awakening game card back in the box and complete the look!
<p> @fusermarucs it‚Äôs absolutely valid to mention those. Others are trying to shame NL for sharing this - it‚Äôs pathetic - the morale crusaders are ruining this site with their constant abuse of NL and it‚Äôs staff. Someone even @ a writer and ask him to defend NL for this article. It‚Äôs pathetic. Most of us a sick of threads like this being derailed by people that think they understand the law. I could even handle the grey area arguments it‚Äôs the shaming NL that I find pathetic.
<p> I‚Äôm glad they posted this and I just wish we could have instead had a conversation about the booklet and the fact booklets are no longer a thing and share links to create content similar like the free ones discussed here but the crusaders scare anyone off from posting links as they be attacked for ‚Äústealing from Nintendo‚Äù
<p> It‚Äôs a nonsense and we are all fed up with the moralistic nonsense by a small minority that derail these threads.
<p> @Thirteen1355 well because the seller is selling something containing protected IP. It is all Nintendo designed characters using Nintendo made graphics sold for profit that isn‚Äôt going to Nintendo isn‚Äôt it?I can‚Äôt write a Star Wars novel for example and then sell it - it is illegal.Maybe this is legal but I highly doubt it. As I said, I‚Äôm sure Nintendo‚Äôs lawyers would argue it isn‚Äôt legal. There‚Äôs a simple reason all the Mario characters are copyrighted and this comes under that remit surely?
<p> So on the other foot - what makes you think it IS legal, out of interest?
<p> @fusermarucs I think that only really concerns video games themselves, as they could impact the property regarding sales etc. Like fangames, rom hacks, the like. Someone made a cooking book containing Breath of the Wild recipes and actively made use of the property. It got heavily crowdfunded and sells for 40 bucks or so. Sells well too. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s illegal. It&#x27;s illegal when you publish actual games based on the property, even if you don&#x27;t ask money for it. These non-game things are more tributes than anything else.
<p> It&#x27;s also complementary, rather than a Star Wars novel which seeks to build upon and actually use the property. I see this manual more like a coloring book containing some Mario stuff.
<p> @fusermarucs &quot;standing up&quot; to what exactly? A guy printing a book for fans of a company too lazy and cheap to do it even as they reap record profits? If you don&#x27;t wanna buy it fair enough, but don&#x27;t give us your morality garbage. Let others make their choices with their own wallets. I don&#x27;t tell you what games to buy or play. It&#x27;s none of my business if you enjoy crap like Animal Crossing and Pokemon and want to buy the memorabilia that comes with it.
<p> And if Nintendo Life wants to promote it so be it. They&#x27;re not forcing you to click, comment or buy anything.
<p> Super Mario All-Stars 25th on the Wii came with its own manual AND a soundtrack CD with an anniversary booklet. Didn&#x27;t exactly set the world on fire but at least it was legit physical bonus content to commemorate the event. What did we get this time? Mario&#x27;s best 3D games badly ported and in need of a 1st day update. Also happy birthday Mario 64, you&#x27;re still in 4:3 and 30fps lol
<p> @Papichulo I didn‚Äôt say I was standing up to anything - that must have been someone else‚Äôs post. In fact reading your whole reply to me i think you got the wrong post - I didn‚Äôt mention animal crossing or Pok√©mon! Neither of which are crap btw.
<p> Anyway I couldn‚Äôt care less if the guy sells it or not- my initial point was surprise that NL was highlighting it. I‚Äôd have commented if they were highlighting a ROM site in the same way.But, just because Nintendo didn‚Äôt do what you want them to doesn‚Äôt make it legal for someone else to do it and sell it. It‚Äôs a simple point - I‚Äôm not debating whether it is ‚Äòright‚Äô or not, just whether it is legal.And what exactly is ‚Äòmorality garbage‚Äô???Is having morals ‚Äògarbage‚Äô now?And if you had actually ‚Äòread‚Äô my posts instead of spewing your own garbage (see what I did there) you‚Äôd have noted that I haven‚Äôt at any point said that the bloke shouldn‚Äôt be selling the booklet, or indeed that Nintendo shouldn‚Äôt have made one themselves - I was just questioning out of genuine interest, if this particular item was legal and if NL should therefore be linking it.
<p> @Cevil. Dude, the first few comments I saw here were people being cynical or calling it &#x27;needless&#x27;. This guy made a professional looking completion guide to 3 amazing games, he at least deserves internet credit.
<p> I‚Äôm 100% okay with this and even selling it. I‚Äôm not okay if it were to include workarounds in the form of amiibo tags or whatever that would provide second methods to legit things. Hoping Nintendo doesn‚Äôt do anything about this.
<p> @fusermarucs the only thing you are standing up to is attacking an individual who made a cute little manual for the sake of defending a multi billion corporation for being lazy and not including it in the first place
<p> If fans have to go above the big corporations head to do what they wanted big corporation to do IN THE FIRST PLACE then it&#x27;s their own damn fault, please step down off that moral high ground now
<p> I miss manuals, especially the old Atari/NES/SNES/Genesis manuals that gave you a couple of paragraphs to explain the story of the game. I appreciate these Etsy sellers and Limited Run Games for making them.
<p> @technotreegrassIndeed!I&#x27;ve ordered Streets of Rage 4 and was surprised that it came with a Manual.Sad that they&#x27;re not included in big Releases like something as a Zelda or Doom.I remember so many Manuals from the Super Nintendo Era, Mortal Kombat, Zelda, Street Fighter 2, Donkey Kong Country...
<p> @BadWaluigi You know they could had still not give us anything for Mario&#x27;s 35th anniversary. The fact that they did means they still care somewhat despite their work being plagiarize multiple times. Not only did they gave us just one collection (3D All-Stars) they gave us two collections (one which is original All-Stars) among the old versions we already had (the original NES versions as well).
