<p> The White House is investigating the ATF’s decision to increase regulation on Q, LLC’s (Q) Honey Badger Pistol, and the agency is warning that other AR-15 pistols may be targeted as well.
<p> Brietbart News reported that the ATF sent Q a Cease &amp; Desist letter, dated August 3, 2020, announcing a reclassification of Q’s Honey Badger Pistol as a short barrel rifle (SBR). This means the pistol now falls under the purview of the National Firearms Act (1934), as do machine guns, suppressors, and SBRs.
<p> The ATF letter noted that two other Q pistols–the Sugar Weasel and the Mini Fix–may also fall under NFA purview.
<p> Q responded to the ATF by issuing its own letter, which began:
<p> Q has ceased all production of the Honey Badger Pistol, and submitted a comprehensive letter to ATF and the Department of Justice stating why we disagree with this classification. Additionally, we have provided recommendations on how to address firearms already in circulation. Q is seeking solutions that best protect you, the individual, and Q’s distribution network from falling out of compliance with ATF regulations, and federal law. At this time, Q has not received and definite guidance from the ATF.
<p> The Honey Badger, Sugar Weasel, and Mini Fix all have stabilizing braces, and the ATF’s letter caused trepidation among owners of what are estimated to be millions of AR-15 pistols with stabilizing braces.
<p> On Saturday the White House told the Washington Beacon that the administration would be looking into the ATF’s actions in order to ensure Second Amendment rights are not being violated.
<p> The White House said, “The White House and leadership at the Department of Justice are reviewing this matter to ensure there is no interference with the ability of law-abiding citizens—including lawful firearms manufacturers—to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed liberties.”
