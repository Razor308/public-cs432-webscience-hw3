<p> As the dust settles on this week&#x27;s big-spending Federal Budget, an ancillary willy-willy has blown up: Is it a blokefest?
<p> Georgie Dent, a writer and executive director of lobby group The Parenthood, penned a scathing account of the Budget in the hours after its release, identifying that the Women&#x27;s Economic Security Statement involved $240 million in funding, compared to the overall spend of $500 billion.
<p> &quot;As many clever economists quickly calculated on Tuesday night that amounts to one third of one per cent of the entire budget. 0.038 per cent to 51 per cent of the population,&quot; Dent wrote, adding that this was an insult to women.
<p> The Women&#x27;s Economic Security Statement was referred to — but not contained in — the copy of the Budget that I received electronically in the Sydney lockup. Many journalists struggled to find it.
<p> The Sydney Morning Herald&#x27;s Canberra reporter Katina Curtis tweeted: &quot;I got my hands on one but only because I went up and asked for it, late in the media lockup. And it&#x27;s printed on regular paper. The department officials said the proper version was still being printed.&quot;
<p> As a statement, it&#x27;s fine — once you locate it.
<p> There&#x27;s a dollop of funding for women&#x27;s leadership programs, some money for STEM cadetships, a sensible adjustment to the work requirements in the paid parental leave scheme worth $90 million or so. All perfectly unexceptionable in an ordinary Budget, in which context it would probably look generous.
<p> In the context of a $500 billion squirt-a-thon, it did look kind of spindly.

<h> Enter the #CredibleWomen
<p> Dent&#x27;s critique was published on Women&#x27;s Agenda, and shared extensively online. She says she received a call on Wednesday morning from a staffer in the Prime Minister&#x27;s office, reproaching her for her argument and claiming that &quot;nothing in the Budget is gendered&quot;. He advised her that &quot;no one credible&quot; was agreeing with her.
<p> Dent was undeterred. Affronted by the suggestion that &quot;no one credible&quot; agreed that the Budget forgot women, she gathered experts online and by the end of the day, the hashtag #CredibleWomen was trending nationally.

<p> In Question Time, the Prime Minister — under questioning by Labor leader Anthony Albanese — held forth indignantly at length, along the &quot;the Budget is gender neutral&quot; lines.
<p> &quot;It may come as some surprise to the Leader of the Opposition, but women run small businesses,&quot; Scott Morrison said.
<p> &quot;Women pay tax. Women hire other Australians in their businesses. Women want to drive on safe roads. Women want to go to university, and they want to study science and technology and engineering and maths, like the Minister for Industry [Karen Andrews] did, becoming an accomplished engineer before she came into this place. They want to get apprenticeships. They want to get traineeships. They want to get jobs.&quot;
<p> And of course, all this is true. Women like safe roads, and having jobs, and all the rest of it. To suggest that every bit of the Budget is for men except the Women&#x27;s Economic Security Statement is, of course, not correct.
<p> But there&#x27;s a reason for the virality — among women in particular, including even some quite credible ones — of Dent&#x27;s sentiments. It has to do with the implicit assumptions in the Budget, and the areas to which generous targeted aid has been focused.
<p> We&#x27;re all Keynesians in this crisis, as has been copiously observed. During the Great Depression, John Maynard Keynes came up with the striking proposition that:
<p> If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coal mines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to the private enterprise ... to dig the notes up again ... there need be no more unemployment and, with the help of the repercussions, the real income of the community ... would probably become a good deal greater than it is.
<p> The point being that creating work for people, and attaching it to an income, is an end in itself for the community. Of course, he went on, if you pay people to do useful and productive stuff, it&#x27;s even better.
<h> It&#x27;s not a &#x27;gender neutral&#x27; stimulus
<p> And so with this stimulus Budget, there are two purposes to every dollar spent. One is to pay someone to do a job. That&#x27;s an end in itself, because that person then spends the wage he or she earns.
<p> The other purpose — if you play your cards right — is to create something that is useful to others in the process.
<p> That was certainly the thinking behind the Pink Batts scheme in the GFC. Pay people to do something (install insulation) that also creates a public good (energy efficiency through insulated homes).
<p> As a Keynesian measure, it was profoundly successful, and Wayne Swan was named Euromoney&#x27;s Finance Minister of the Year. As a public administration measure, it was less of a success, as you will no doubt recall.
<p> So what about roads? Here, the second part of the equation is clear. Yes, women and men both benefit from roads. And dams! And all the other shovel-appropriate construction measures.
<p> But what of the first? Who builds roads? What sort of jobs does this physical infrastructure spending support?
<p> The &quot;woman question&quot; is obviously one the PM&#x27;s office is conscious of. (ABC News: Andy Kennedy)
<p> &quot;The three sectors with the most targeted support are all bloke-heavy: construction (more than $10 billion so far through the crisis), energy ($4 billion), and manufacturing ($3 billion),&quot; Wood writes with co-authors Kate Griffiths and Tom Crowley.
<p> &quot;There is also an extra $10 billion for transport projects, another boost to construction jobs in the building phase.&quot;
<p> Of course, it&#x27;s excellent to create jobs, especially for casual or contract workers in these sectors who may not have benefited from JobKeeper.
<p> And who are they, exactly?
<p> According to Rebecca Cassells and Alan Duncan from the Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre, there are about 72,000 male casuals in the construction sector and about 5,000 female ones, who on account of having work contracts of less than 12 months may have missed out on JobKeeper. In manufacturing, there are about 39,000 male casuals and 21,000 women.
<p> It&#x27;s not gender-neutral stimulus, in other words. Sure, women like driving on roads, but they&#x27;re not going to be the ones building them.
<h> How are these decisions made? And who makes them?
<p> Not that this in itself is necessarily important. Stimulus should go to hard-hit sectors, right? It shouldn&#x27;t matter what kind of chromosomal pattern is dominant.
<p> But here again, the data doesn&#x27;t match the scale. Construction is nowhere near the hardest-hit sector in this recession. It&#x27;s just the best-funded in the Budget.
<p> This chart, from Wood and her co-authors, offers a brutal visual account of the mismatch between actual damage incurred so far in 2020 on various sectors and the amount of stimulatory spending deployed.
<p> For good measure, each sector is tinted to represent the dominant gender of its employees. You can see that construction (heavily male) has received the most assistance but is only middlingly afflicted. The arts, meanwhile, is both the most stricken and the least assisted.
<p> This raises several urgent questions. How are these decisions made? Who makes them? And what world view do these decision-makers have?
<p> They&#x27;re made by political leaders who are under pressure, of course, and who are — like all of us — instructed by their own lifespans of experience.
<p> The Prime Minister and the Treasurer would remember, from their youths, the recessions of the 1980s and the 1990s.
<p> Perhaps the Keating &quot;recession we had to have&quot; crimped their expectations of work, like they did mine (I&#x27;m about the same age as Frydenberg) when I loitered about at university for a few years more than was necessary, working at a service station and going to the pub a lot.
<p> Back then, the recessions hit men. In the 1990s recession, 85 per cent of the jobs lost were men&#x27;s jobs, and in the 1980s it was 76 per cent.
<p> The economic reforms of the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s were terribly difficult, and involved Labor leaders making decisions which struck at their own manufacturing heartland in the interests of future prosperity (always the sign of substantial leadership, as shown years later by John Howard when he faced down conservative opposition to gun control legislation as an investment in future generations not being murdered).
<p> The victims of these reforms, and those recessions, were men. So it&#x27;s kind of understandable that the knee-jerk idea of what is appropriate stimulus in these instances is: What can we get men to do?
<p> Add to this the still terribly dominant assumption in Australia that husbands are the breadwinners and women the homemakers, and it&#x27;s easy to see how you could arrive at the presumption that the way to protect Australian families through a recession is ... make sure Dad has a job.
<h> This recession has bitten into feminised work
<p> The difference is, this recession has attacked women.
<p> And in the decades since the nation last experienced a significant downturn, something else has happened, too: Women — particularly older women — now outnumber men on the unemployment lines.
<p> As the figures below show, more unemployed men than women will be eligible for the JobMaker scheme in which the Government will directly sponsor Australians under 35 for jobs with willing employers.

<p> The recession has bitten into feminised work, as has the virus itself.
<p> &quot;Unlike past recessions, the worst fallout in the COVID-19 recession has been in services sectors,&quot; Wood writes.
<p> &quot;Hospitality, the arts and administrative services have all been hit hard. These sectors are dominated by women, which is one reason women&#x27;s employment has taken a bigger hit this year. Yet these sectors received next to nothing in the budget. They are also less likely to benefit from economy-wide supports such as instant asset write-offs because they are the least capital-intensive sectors.&quot;
<p> Where will the grand scale take-up for the asset write-off — at $27 billion, the most generous headline item in the Budget — come from? From sectors with the cash reserves to make major capital investments (hello, resources sector).
<p> Wood argues that the Budget could have done all sorts of things to help the parts of the Australian economy where women are over-represented.

<p> &quot;Overseas governments, and some state and local governments, have funded vouchers and discounts to encourage people back to restaurants, cafes and regional tourist destinations,&quot; she writes.
<p> &quot;Grants or direct support to help the arts sector revive could provide a desperately needed boost to our creative recovery. The government could have created many more jobs by directly investing in government services. Services create more jobs than infrastructure per dollar spent, and they have especially high economic multipliers right now.&quot;
<p> Think of the election ads you&#x27;ve seen. How is the concept of &quot;jobs&quot; traditionally evoked? How much high-vis is worn in those ads? How many hard-hats? How many cheerful welders, tilting their masks to give a cheery grin? How many farmers, summoning their sheepdogs?
<p> The pictures we are asked to associate with productivity aren&#x27;t ever in call centres or supermarkets.
<p> Even the way the Treasurer talked about the asset write-off during his speech made it pretty clear what he had in mind. (Businesses could buy a truck! A harvester!)
<p> The argument isn&#x27;t that women don&#x27;t benefit at all from any of this stuff. It&#x27;s just that the prime spending areas are in sectors dominated by men, and the sectors in which women are equal or dominant (arts, hospitality, retail, administration, education) have been harder hit, but given less assistance.
<h> Inside the &#x27;razor gang&#x27;
<p> It&#x27;s worth a brief return to the question of who makes these decisions.
<p> Yes, it&#x27;s the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, but it&#x27;s also the powerful Expenditure Review Committee, the Budget &quot;razor gang&quot; which, through many administrations, has had the hard work of disappointing the hopeful bidders of the broader Cabinet.
<p> In December last year, the PM whittled down the membership of the ERC to include only himself, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack and Health Minister Greg Hunt.
<p> The new, trimmed-down, all-male ERC was reported in December by The Australian as part of its &quot;Power List&quot;, an annual feature which sets out a complicated diagram of all the advisers close to the PM.
<p> It stuck in my mind because of how few women were in the diagram. (Of the 13 named members of the PM&#x27;s &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot;, for instance, only one — national security adviser Michelle Chan, since appointed deputy secretary in the Office of National Intelligence) — was a woman. It was the blokiest &quot;PM&#x27;s network&quot; I can remember seeing in all the years The Australian has been compiling the list.
<p> The ERC continued to be a blokes-only affair through June, when in the space of a week the Government announced $688 million for the construction industry, and targeted the childcare sector for early removal of Jobkeeper support.
<p> Questions were raised at this time about the gendered nature of these decisions, and the priorities they revealed.
<p> Is it surprising that a group of men who have never personally experienced barriers to workforce entry due to childcare obligations might overlook the fairly central role that childcare plays in women&#x27;s participation?
<p> The ERC was still listed on the Government directory until Thursday as an all-male committee, but Social Services Minister Anne Ruston was actually admitted as a full-time member in late June.
<p> But the point remains that the group of people making the huge decisions in this Budget is male-dominated in the extreme. It&#x27;s not suggested that they are ill-motivated or hostile to women.
<p> It&#x27;s not necessary to establish animus here. It&#x27;s simply the case that diverse groups are better at making decisions for diverse populations.
<h> The gender trends are clear
<p> Recently, I was chatting with a woman who&#x27;d sat in on a Cabinet-level meeting dealing with the tax treatment of online shopping.
<p> In the general discussion that ensued, the male Treasurer at the time expressed the view that while people might make large purchases online, it was hardly a platform you&#x27;d use to shop for groceries.
<p> The handful of women present who, like the Treasurer, worked long hours, and had found that online grocery shopping was the only way they could keep their fridges stocked, exchanged amused glances.
<p> Men and women have different experiences of life and work in this country. That&#x27;s not necessarily a thing that should (or could) ever be eliminated. But if a democracy is doing its job, it should reflect those different experiences faithfully, especially given that — as the Prime Minister says — women pay tax, too.
<p> On Thursday morning, Senator Ruston appeared on ABC TV. &quot;Every single measure in the budget is available for women,&quot; she said. &quot;To suggest the Budget doesn&#x27;t focus on women, I think, is wrong.&quot;
