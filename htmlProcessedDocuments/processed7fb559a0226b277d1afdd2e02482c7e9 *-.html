<p> The combination of the message&#x27;s vagueness and countdown timer alarmed me. Why did I need to change my passcode? And why did I have to do so within a given amount of time?
<p> I ignored the prompt to see what would happen, and luckily nothing did. My iPhone didn&#x27;t lock itself or self destruct after an hour like I had initially feared.
<p> It wasn&#x27;t until my mom texted me out of the blue a few days later that I began to really scratch my head. She had received the exact same prompt on her iPhone and was worried she&#x27;d fallen victim to some kind of malware that was trying to worm its way into her device.
<p> The odds of being infected by a virus on the iPhone are basically zero if you&#x27;re not jailbroken, so I knew that wasn&#x27;t the case.
<p> After some digging and a chat with Apple customer support, I&#x27;ve found that no one really knows why the prompt exists.But it likely has something to do with websites you&#x27;ve visited in Safari on the iPhone.
<p> Companies can force their employees to reset their iPhone passcode if they install a MDM (Mobile Device Management) profile. But this particular prompt appears on iPhones with and without profiles installed.
<p> You can reset your Safari browser data from the app&#x27;s menu in the Settings app.
Tech Insider
<p> One MacRumors forum member called Apple customer support and was told to reset all history and data stored in the Safari app on his iPhone. I asked Apple support about it.
<p> &quot;If it is a pop up then that [resetting Safari] can certainly take care of the issue,&quot; a representative told me through Apple&#x27;s customer support chat. &quot;That is what we do when customers think they have a virus with pop ups.&quot;
<p> He said that the message doesn&#x27;t mean an iPhone has been infected by any kind of malware, but he also couldn&#x27;t answer why the message was likely related to websites I&#x27;d visited in Safari.
<p> &quot;When customers contact us they believe it is a virus but it isn&#x27;t,&quot; he said. &quot;I would ignore it and clear the website history in Safari.&quot;
<p> We asked Apple itself for an explanation, but haven&#x27;t heard back as of publishing.
<p> So if you get the mysterious &quot;Passcode Requirement&quot; prompt on your iPhone, you can either ignore it like I did or clear your browsing history and data in Safari. At least your iPhone isn&#x27;t (probably) infected with malware.
