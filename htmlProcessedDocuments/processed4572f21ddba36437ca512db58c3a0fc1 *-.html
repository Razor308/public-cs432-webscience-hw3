<p> Last night, Don Jr. touched down in Panama City Beach, Florida to hold a small gathering of like-minded friends to discuss politics in a masked, socially-distanced setting. LOL just kidding. He hosted a standing-room-only rally of shrieking covidiots, and reports say there was nary a mask in sight. Cool!
<p> Clearly, attendees and special guests didn’t read the news from the last week involving an avalanche of positive COVID tests stemming from a White House ceremony announcing Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Get in there real close, Jimmy. Nothing to see here in regard to possibly infected respiratory droplets.
<p> Of course, this shouldn’t come as a surprise considering the president’s own totally cavalier and scientifically inaccurate view of things. Only a week ago, he was hospitalized due to his own diagnosis and reportedly had a fever and required oxygen. Reports of his health status throughout his stay were sketchy AF and have continued to be all week as he rage-tweeted from the White House. And now, he’s planning on a live “medical examination” tonight on Fox News. Because of course he is.
<p> In yet another incredibly disturbing development, Trump’s doctor announced yesterday that he’s able to return to public engagements as soon as tomorrow. Hours later, Trump shared plans with Sean Hannity for a rally ASAP. “I think I’m gonna try doing a rally on Saturday night if we have enough time to put it together — but we wanna do a rally, probably in Florida on Saturday night,” he said. “We might come back and do one in Pennsylvania the following night, and it’s incredible what’s going on. I feel so good.”
<p> The sad part is, thousands of his followers will line up for the president to cough on them without a second thought. Let’s slow this down a second to properly absorb it — the president tested positive for the virus late last Thursday. That means that as of today, he’s only nine total days out from that diagnosis. That makes tomorrow day 10, which just barely squeaks in for the safe period for quarantining post-diagnosis.
<p> Doctors also threw a pu pu platter of drugs at him including one that’s still experimental. “Since returning home, his physical exam has remained stable and devoid of any indications to suggest progression of illness,” Conley said. “Overall he’s responded extremely well to treatment, without evidence on examination of adverse therapeutic effects.”
<p> Wouldn’t one think that after the president, first lady, and a number of people in their orbit were diagnosed with the virus that they might reevaluate how things are done? Or at least express the smallest amount of concern over transmission of a virus that most Americans won’t be able to fight with the cadre of expensive therapies afforded to Trump himself? Of course not. There’s lies — and respiratory droplets — to spew. The show must go on, no matter the human cost.
<p> We know the more people come together during COVID-19, especially indoors without proper social distancing and safety protocols, the greater the risk for COVID-19 transmission. But during a call with governors on Oct.
<p> And Vernon Jones doesn’t regret it one bit George state rep Vernon Jones has a new nickname following his ill-advised idiotic crowdsurf at Friday night’s Georgia Trump rally: “Captain COVID.” At President Trump’s crowded campaign rally at the Middle Georgia Regional Airport in Macon, GA, Trump-supporting Democrat Jones not only thought it was a great []
<p> The last eight months during the pandemic has certainly tested our resilience, and with winter approaching, the need to continue to adapt is at an all-time high. According to Yahoo Life mental health contributor, Jen Hartstein, even if you&#x27;re not diagnosed with Seasonal Affective Disorder, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ve experienced the &#x27;winter blues&#x27; that it often brings. “Serotonin levels tend to drop and serotonin is one of the neurotransmitters we need to help boost our mood and keep us feeling more up,” she says. “We also know that our melatonin levels change and melatonin is really impactful in how our sleep cycles work…[it] will impact our mood and our feeling sad and anxious.” With the darkness setting in earlier and earlier, our biological rhythm is thrown off, and our bodies may feel that it’s time to go to bed early in the day causing us to feel lethargic.&amp;nbsp; Hartstein offer some tips for coping with feelings of despair that the cold weather may bring on while we deal with fears surrounding the pandemic. “Get outside and get that natural light as much as you can, even if it&#x27;s just walking around the block,” Hartstein says. When we’re exposed to sunlight, our bodies naturally produce Vitamin D which combats the negative effects of seasonal depression. “This is a challenging time. We&#x27;re still uncertain, we&#x27;re still worried, and then add to it that it&#x27;s going to get dark and cold and more challenging to be with the people you care about,” Hartstein says. “So validate that that&#x27;s frustrating and that you&#x27;re feeling overwhelmed by it, and then slow yourself down to figure out what you can do about it.”
