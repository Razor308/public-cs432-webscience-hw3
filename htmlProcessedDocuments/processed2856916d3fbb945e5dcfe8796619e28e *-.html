<p> Authorities in Colorado are defending their decision to send two school resource officers to a home where a 12-year-old Black boy pointed a gun that turned out to be a toy at a friend during an online class they were taking together.
<p> The rant about their students goes on for nearly two minutes.
<p> &quot;I was heartbroken, angry, upset, confused. I couldn&#x27;t believe I heard that come out of a teacher&#x27;s mouth,&quot; said parent Chanel Bonner, who recorded the conversation.
<p> Bonner said her son, Ri&#x27;Quan, a sophomore, tried to clarify a question about his assignment at the end of his English class. She said one of the teachers then accused Ri&#x27;Quan of not submitting his work.
<p> Bonner said it was clear the teachers didn&#x27;t realize they forgot to logout.
<p> &quot;Other students were still logged in, other parents were still logged in, even commenting like, &#x27;Do you know you&#x27;re still being recorded?&#x27;&quot; she said.
<p> Our sister station KGO-TV reached out to the Vallejo Unified School District for an interview but was sent the following statement:
<p> &quot;VCUSD takes all student and parent complaints very seriously. We will evaluate our policies and procedures for online instruction, and will address any specific complaints regarding the appropriate conduct of our faculty and staff. We regret that any students were offended by this incident, and we will work carefully to resolve this matter.&quot;
