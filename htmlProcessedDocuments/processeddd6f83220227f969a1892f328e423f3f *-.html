<h> Announcing Details for Xbox FanFest
<h> Summary​
<p> Beginning October 12 at 6 p.m. PT, we’ll open a year-round registration to join as an Xbox FanFest fan.
<p> Once registered, fans can opt-in to participate in exclusive experiences offered throughout the year.
<p> Xbox FanFest was created with a passion to give back to our fans. It has been an amazing 6 years of in-person FanFest events. We dearly miss connecting with the Xbox community and sharing these experiences with you. While our in-person events are on hold, we decided what better time than now to expand FanFest in a way that allows more fans the opportunity to come together throughout the year.
<p> I am excited to share that we are expanding Xbox FanFest, adding digital exclusive experiences for fans to jump in and participate virtually in some really fun ways. By opening an ongoing registration site, fans can sign up to be an Xbox FanFest fan and opt-in to year-round exclusive experiences curated just for FanFest.
