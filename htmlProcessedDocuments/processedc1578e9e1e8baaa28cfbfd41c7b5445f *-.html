<p> A scathing report from the Washington Free Beacon claims NBC News misled viewers during a town hall event by portraying “undecided voters” who had previously pledged their support for Joe Biden.
<p> “Lawyer Peter Gonzalez and marketing executive Ismael Llano posed questions to Biden during a town hall on Monday, when he appeared before what the network described as an ‘audience of undecided Florida voters,’” reports the Free Beacon.
<p> Both Gonzalez and Llano, however, were featured in an MSNBC segment in August to explain why they support Biden. “If we get four more years of Trump, good luck, and good luck with the future attracting younger voters,” Gonzalez said as an MSNBC chyron noted he was “voting for Biden.” Llano was also identified as “voting for Biden” and offered praise for the former vice president.
<p> On Monday, NBC’s Lester Holt said that Llano “voted for Hillary Clinton four years ago but has voted Republican in the past.” Gonzalez, whose voting history went unmentioned, asked Biden to ease his family’s concerns that the Democrat is beholden to “the radical left.”
<p> “The 2020 candidate pulled off a rare showing in an Economist/YouGov poll published Wednesday, tying the largely untouchable former Vice President Joe Biden with 26 percent support among registered voters. It marks one of the few polls where Biden is within danger of losing his frontrunner status, and contains a dismal prediction for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.),” reports The Week magazine.
<p> “Biden has only had a few close calls in previous polls, but Warren’s 2020 rise has seemingly been eating away at his support as well as Sanders’. In a late August poll from Monmouth University, Sanders and Warren topped the pool with 20 percent support, and Biden was just behind at 19 percent. In this Economist/YouGov poll, Biden is back up, but so is Warren, both leaving Sanders a full 10 points behind at 16 percent,” adds the website.
<p> Former Vice President Joe Biden continued his gaffe-laden campaign while departing New Hampshire this week; bizarrely grabbing a reporter’s microphone when asked to comment on the state of the 2020 Democratic Primary.
<p> “Look, I told you in the beginning. The first quarter of this campaign is the first four caucuses and primaries. That’s what this is all about, then we go from there,” said Biden. “Everybody talks about the past. Clinton lost 9 primaries and won only one.”
<p> “I’m getting on a plane, heading down there, doing a little rally in South Carolina,” he added as one reporter held a microphone up to better hear the Vice President. “Don’t poke that in my face, alright buddy?!”
