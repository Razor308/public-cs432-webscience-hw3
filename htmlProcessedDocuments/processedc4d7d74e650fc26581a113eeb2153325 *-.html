<p> According to a thread over on the Nintendo Switch subreddit (and archived on ResetEra when the original post was removed by moderators), the full game was made available via the Mexican eShop for a very brief amount of time, not long after the game was announced.
<p> Of course, someone managed to download the entire thing in this short time frame and since then has been uploading footage of the Switch version over on Imgur - which will no doubt interest anyone who wants to see the remaster running in handheld mode.
<p> To be fair, the official Need for Speed website has already confirmed the specs:
<p> Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered has been upgraded for todayâ€™s generation of hardware with enhanced visuals. The Nintendo Switch version runs at 1080p/30 FPS in docked mode (720p/30 FPS undocked) and includes higher-resolution models, more objects and props, longer draw distance, higher resolution shadows, and improved videos.
<p> After the word got out about this early release, the game was quickly knocked back to pre-order only. Despite the blunder, there&#x27;s at least one person out there now playing the game more than an entire month before its official release.
<p> Will you be returning to the remaster of Criterion&#x27;s 2010 title when it arrives on Switch next month? Have you ever been lucky enough to download and play a game ahead of its official release? Tell us down below.

<p> What the Switch version will kinda look like, if this still impressed you or doesn&#x27;t affect you that much then you&#x27;ll had no problem getting this game. It&#x27;s basically an on the go version of a PS3/Xbox 360 game.
<p> I thought Nintendo could just lock the accidental downloads for the time being, but either they don&#x27;t care much or it&#x27;s only applicable to the titles with an existing preload option.
<p> @durr I platted Most Wanted 2012 on Vita - agile, responsive, a blast to play. But then again, I can feel a bit nauseous at the thought of a racing game with touch screen controls (even after experiencing not unplayable specimens like MKT), so to each their own.ðŸ˜›
<p> EDIT: turns out, the game IS available for preload. But the mistakenly unlocked versions from a few days ago can&#x27;t have another timestamp imposed?
<p> I have 2 simple equations -30 fps = perfectly fine60 fps = great stuffWhat I don&#x27;t have is time to connect up my switch to a PC to check the FPS and cry if it dips at anytime whatsoever and claim we&#x27;ve all been had by the developer, its worst than joy con drift conspiracy theorists! Just play the game and enjoy yourself!
<p> Isn&#x27;t this a Nintendo news site? Ya know. Nintendo. The company with the console whose third-party ports can only maintain a stable 30 FPS if we&#x27;re lucky? Did I... did I wander into the wrong comments section?
<p> Even the base Xbox and PS4 versions are 30 fps... the original game was 30fps.... chill out. It was great to play then it&#x27;ll be great to play now. Anyone else saying different is just an FPS snob..... yes you are....... yes....... you are. Games have been played and enjoyed for decades at 30fps. 60 is nice to have but its not the ONLY option. Otherwise I suspect you guys have got 1 maybe 2 games for the Switch, and that&#x27;s a sad experience.
<p> all this fps stress. Why? 30 fps as long as its consistent is perfectly acceptable and you adjust to it quickly. If a game not running at 60fps really is the reason for you not to play a game then you&#x27;re missing out on a lot of great games.
<p> 1) It&#x27;s taking a little longer to get the carts ready2) There&#x27;s a day 1 patch for Switch but is still in approval with Nintendo3) EA just hates Nintendo and have deliberately decided to release later so people decide to buy on PS4/Xbox instead and EA can say &quot;See! The Switch isn&#x27;t a viable console for us&quot;.
<p> I can imagine 1 or 2 is most likely, but everyone will jump and accept it&#x27;s 3 xD
<p> @durr Really? I run Forza Horizon 4 in both 1080p60 and 4k30 mode on Xbox One X and to be honest couldn&#x27;t tell the difference other than the additional detail present in 4K quality mode. Control and everything is responsive and smooth in both modes.
<p> If it maintains a solid 30 lock it will be perfectly fine. I would imagine there would have to be significant visual and resolution downgrades on Switch to make that 60fps and obviously the developers decided in playtesting the difference wasn&#x27;t worth it.
<p> I&#x27;d say this guy managed to spoil himself.As for the game, I think 30 fps are totally fine. I love Grid Autosport and I can&#x27;t see why I shouldn&#x27;t like this title as well.
<p> @Kezza64 there&#x27;s nothing choppy in a game that runs at 30fps consistently, you probably felt sick because of framerate drops. GTA V is known to have slowdowns on a PS3, but it runs fine on a PS4 with the same nominal framerate.
<p> @status-204 Oh you Pc Master race tard. Why are you here?30 fps when it&#x27;s locked is fine. Butter smooth. Stop embarrassing yourself by making idiotic comments . You think you know but you don&#x27;t. And ......damn you for triggering me this beautiful hot day
<p> @arpaktiko What&#x27;s wrong with you? Did you actually read a single word? And don&#x27;t blame me for your fragile psyche.
<p> Let me clarify: My comment is about how 30fps on a CRT display vs. modern LCD and LED displays is very different. Not about PC. Not about &quot;60 fps being superior&quot; (even if it would always be preferable). Learn to read words and not project. If you don&#x27;t understand what I mean by saying they&#x27;re different, go google and learn something for once in your life.
<p> @russellohh you are joking right? The humble NES outputs at 50 or 60 FPS but weâ€™re talking about Game rendering FPS. The console has to output a solid 50 or 60hz for compatibility with the TV. But thatâ€™s not what people are talking about when they discuss / bemoan FPS. You can have a game render at 1 FPS and the console will output that one frame 60 times every second and itâ€™d be impossible to play by todayâ€™s standards even though the console is outputting 60hz/FPS.
<p> @Silly_G Hmm. I actually was unsure while writing if I had a 386 or a 486. I know it was one of these and that Duke (shareware) ran like a slideshow. But as a kid I was fascinated by it anyway.
Could 486 be more realistic?
<p> @Yanina : Definitely. Duke Nukem 3D was far too &quot;cutting edge&quot; to have worked on a 386, and the official system requirements would have specified 486 as a minimum. Even the original DOOM (which is far less demanding) needed a 486 to run properly, and that was released back in 1993.
<p> Duke Nukem was designed for 286, Duke Nukem II for 386, and Duke Nukem 3D for 486. I&#x27;ve had all three back in the day, so I have some idea as to what games can run on what hardware.
<p> @ukaskew : There are only very, very few films shot/produced at 60fps. Most projectors aren&#x27;t designed for it and no-one in their right mind would produce a film in a frame rate that most displays/projectors aren&#x27;t fit to play. Care to name the film that you&#x27;ve seen?
<p> The Hobbit films were released with 47.952fps (double 23.976) versions theatrically, though I imagine that very, very few cinemas would have been equipped to play them at their intended frame rate.
<p> @Perryg92 I really don&#x27;t get the week later release either. I think it will still do well on the Switch bc people, given the multiple consoles will probably hold out a few days longer if for no other reason portability.
<p> @Ironcore@status-204 I will agree unreservedly that racing games should aim for refresh rates of 60+ FPS. I am surprised that this is even in dispute. However, just a bit less aggression might be better here.
<p> @FTL Movies are not so affected as the screens tend to spend more time being still than a game. much like fps makes no difference to a chess game, it could be 1fps and still play the same. I often have to look away during panning shots where the film is running a low fps. I don&#x27;t go to the cinema for a few reasons and this is one of them.
<p> @Ironcore Actually just specifically related to the panning shots - I wonder if youâ€™re not seeing the downside to a particular compression option using modern codecs which lose tracking as the camera pans and you see a jerking motion whenever the scene pans or changes to the side.. It is seen in many movies these days - or on mpeg / h.264 compression. Just food for thought.
