<p> &quot;Delaying this vital piece of legislation until the last minute could lead to less scrutiny, fewer chances to improve it and a cliff edge in the environmental safeguards and their enforcement once EU rules no longer apply.&quot;
<p> She called for a &quot;powerful, independent watchdog that can hold ministers&#x27; feet to the fire when it comes to protecting the living world&quot;.
<p> After the resumption of parliamentary business in the summer, bills on immigration, trade, pensions, and the Commonwealth Games were all brought back before MPs – but the environment bill has yet to be so.
<p> The government has extended the bill&#x27;s timetable three times, and Labour says the latest schedule means MPs will not be able to give it detailed scrutiny until 1 December – the start of a process that takes months.
<p> Luke Pollard, Labour’s shadow environment secretary, said: &quot;The government’s dither and delay highlights a worrying lack of focus on the urgent need to protect our environment. We cannot afford any more government incompetence. Ministers need to act now.&quot;
<p> The government says it is committed to resuming passage of the bill. A Defra spokesperson said: “We are committed to a greener future, which is why we are setting ambitious goals for nature and biodiversity in our landmark Environment Bill, as well as introducing new ways to reward farmers for protecting the environment and investing £640m in the Nature for Climate Fund.
