<h> Faulty generalization
<p> In logic and reasoning, a faulty generalization, similar to a proof by example in mathematics, is a conclusion made about all or many instances of a phenomenon, that has been reached on the basis of one or a few instances of that phenomenon.[1][2] It is an example of jumping to conclusions.[3] For example, one may generalize about all people or all members of a group, based on what they know about just one or a few people:
<p> If one meets an angry person from a given country X, they may suspect that most people in country X are often angry.
<p> If one sees only white swans, they may suspect that all swans are white.
<p> Faulty generalizations may lead to further incorrect conclusions. One may, for example, conclude that citizens of country X are genetically inferior, or that poverty is the fault of the poor.
<p> Expressed in more precise philosophical language, a fallacy of defective induction is a conclusion that has been made on the basis of weak premises, or one which is not justified by sufficient or unbiased evidence.[4] Unlike fallacies of relevance, in fallacies of defective induction, the premises are related to the conclusions, yet only weakly buttress the conclusions, hence a faulty generalization is produced. The essence of this inductive fallacy lies on the overestimation of an argument based on insufficiently-large samples under an implied margin or error.[3]
<p> Hasty generalization is the fallacy of examining just one or very few examples or studying a single case, and generalizing that to be representative of the whole class of objects or phenomena.
<p> The opposite, slothful induction, is the fallacy of denying the logical conclusion of an inductive argument, dismissing an effect as &quot;just a coincidence&quot; when it is very likely not.
<p> The overwhelming exception is related to the hasty generalization, but working from the other end. It is a generalization which is accurate, but tags on a qualification which eliminates enough cases (as exceptions); that what remains is much less impressive than what the original statement might have led one to assume.
<p> Statistical special pleading occurs when the interpretation of the relevant statistic is &quot;massaged&quot; by looking for ways to reclassify or requantify data from one portion of results, but not applying the same scrutiny to other categories.[6]
<p> Hasty generalization is an informal fallacy of faulty generalization, which involves reaching an inductivegeneralization based on insufficient evidence[4]â€”essentially making a rushed conclusion without considering all of the variables. In statistics, it may involve basing broad conclusions regarding the statistics of a survey from a small sample group that fails to sufficiently represent an entire population.[2][7][8] Its opposite fallacy is called slothful induction, which consists of denying a reasonable conclusion of an inductive argument (e.g. &quot;it was just a coincidence&quot;).
<p> For example, if a person travels through a town for the first time and sees 10 people, all of them children, they may erroneously conclude that there are no adult residents in the town.
<p> Alternatively, a person might look at a number line, and notice that the number 1 is a square number; 3 is a prime number, 5 is a prime number, and 7 is a prime number; 9 is a square number; 11 is a prime number, and 13 is a prime number. From these observations, the person might claim that all odd numbers are either prime or square, while in reality, 15 is an example which disproves the claim.
