<p> Some guests for Saturday&#x27;s White House event on the South Lawn, which will be President Donald Trump&#x27;s first since testing positive for the coronavirus, had their travel and lodging paid for by controversial conservative activist Candace Owens&#x27; group BLEXIT, according to emails obtained by ABC News.
<p> Supporters, who are also scheduled to attend a separate BLEXIT event earlier in the day, were invited to attend a &quot;HUGE outdoor rally&quot; by the group and asked to fill out a form that notified them that BLEXIT, a campaign urging Black Americans to leave the Democratic Party, will be covering travel costs.
<p> Guests were later informed they would be receiving an invitation from the White House to attend an event with Trump.
<p> In an email from Owens, obtained by ABC News, attendees were told &quot;EVERYONE MUST BRING A MASK TO BE ALLOWED ENTRY ONTO THE WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS.&quot; and that &quot;absolutely no exceptions&quot; will be made.
<p> Still, wearing a face mask will not be required. Attendees will have to submit to a COVID-19 screening the morning of the event, which will consist of a temperature check and a brief questionnaire.
<p> Guests will first attend a &quot;BLEXIT Back the Blue event&quot; on the Ellipse between the White House and the Washington Monument before heading over to the South Lawn for the president&#x27;s remarks, according to a schedule obtained by ABC News.
<p> When reached for comment, Owens told ABC News, &quot;We are not interested in participating in your obvious media angle here to slander/attack the President regarding Covid-19.&quot; She added that Saturday&#x27;s event &quot;is about supporting law enforcement in minority communities.&quot; It is not immediately clear how many of those set to attend the event had their travel costs covered.

<p> White House spokesman Judd Deere told ABC News the White House &quot;is not involved in covering any cost.&quot;
<p> Following Trump&#x27;s remarks, the BLEXIT group is also planning a demonstration at Black Lives Matter Plaza showing &quot;support for law enforcement,&quot; according to the schedule.
<p> The White House plans to host an event on Saturday featuring Trump with hundreds of supporters and guests from Owens&#x27; group on the South Lawn discussing &quot;law and order,&quot; ABC News previously reported.
<p> &quot;All attendees must bring a mask with them and will be instructed to wear it on the White House Complex. All attendees must submit to a COVID-19 screening tomorrow morning. This will consist of a temperature check and a brief questionnaire. The health and safety of all attendees is our priority and following CDC guidelines is strongly encouraged,&quot; a source with knowledge of the group&#x27;s planning told ABC News.
<p> Trump will deliver &quot;remarks to peaceful protesters for law and order,&quot; according to an invite obtained by ABC News and confirmed by two White House sources familiar with the planning. The move underscores an effort to deliver the president a packed crowd of supporters for the event as he struggles with support among Black voters. Joe Biden led Trump, 88% to 9%, among Black registered voters, according to a Sept. 26 ABC/Washington Post poll.
<p> Owens, who founded BLEXIT in 2018, told ABC News it is an organization &quot;with the purpose of educating minorities about conservative principles (free markets, entrepreneurship, capitalism, etc) -- concepts and theories that can truly transform and uplift our communities.&quot;

<p> In an Instagram post last week, Owens promoted what she called an upcoming &quot;anti-Black Lives Matter event,&quot; and urged followers to submit to attend in person. &quot;We are giving away a limited amount of travel stipends to those that really them,&quot; she said in the post.
<p> &quot;Our president doesn&#x27;t want us to be fearful or scared,&quot; one person planning to attend Saturday&#x27;s events told ABC News. &quot;Look how he came out of it. He popped right back. We have got to stop being afraid of this.&quot;
<p> &quot;We got to take this mask off, we have to unmask America,&quot; the person added.
<p> Attendees for Saturday&#x27;s event were also told, &quot;EVERYONE MUST WEAR A BLEXIT T-SHIRT (Which will be given to you ahead of the event) -- no exceptions.&quot;
