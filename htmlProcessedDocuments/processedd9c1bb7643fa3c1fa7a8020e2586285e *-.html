<p> MENLO PARK, CAâ€”To encourage more responsible posting during a deadly pandemic, Facebook has announced it will attach warnings to any posts expressing hope, optimism, confidence, or good cheer until the virus threat has passed.
<p> &quot;In light of recent reckless statements by the President, we believe expressing any sort of optimism to be completely irresponsible during this deadly time,&quot; said Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. &quot;If we allow our users to feel any sense of hope, they may let their guard down. Worse, they may even take off their masks!&quot;
<p> Starting this week, all Facebook posts that show any hint of confidence that everything is going to be OK will be labeled with a &quot;potential false hope&quot; warning, and friends will be prompted to confirm that they really want to share such things during a pandemic.
<p> According to sources, exceptions will be made for Joe Biden&#x27;s Facebook account since any hope he shares is without malarkey and totally reliable.
<p> &quot;Here at Facebook we are proud to be on the cutting edge of safety and security,&quot; said Zuckerberg. &quot;Everything&#x27;s gonna be OK, we promise.&quot;
