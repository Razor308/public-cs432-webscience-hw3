<p> We&#x27;re excited to share that all of our PS4 games will be backwards compatible on #PS5, including: The Last of Us Part II, The Last of Us Remastered, Uncharted 4, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, Uncharted 1 - 3, and the Jak series!
<p> Unfortunately, there‚Äôs been no word from the studio about any patches or upgrades to its existing titles. Sucker Punch announced overnight that it‚Äôs adding a new option to Ghost of Tsushima that will allow it to run at 60 frames-per-second on Sony‚Äôs next-gen console courtesy of the system‚Äôs Game Boost feature, but there‚Äôs been no similar comment from Naughty Dog just yet. There‚Äôs still time for it to make announcements of that nature, but we‚Äôd recommend you lower your expectations on that front for now.
<p> In their blog yesterday Sony stated that using the Dualshock controller&#x27;s were required for best performance when playing PS4 games on the PS5. One of the big reasons why I pre-ordered a PS5 was so I can play PS4 games with the Dualsense, as I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of their existing controller&#x27;s. Why do you think Sony made that statement?
<p> @GZoo Due to the fact that ones muscle memory will assist in playing with what you&#x27;re already used to. The fact that the haptics and so on won&#x27;t be utilised and so forth. Overall, it&#x27;s just their way of saying each to their own, but for people to not expect anything different with a Dualsense.
<p> @GZoo Plus, also covers them in the sense of anything unexpected behaviour wise with the Dualsense, they can state that they advised it would be best with a Dualshock. Much like how you can play PSNow on PC with a 360 controller, but then games that include the touchpad or motion you&#x27;re screwed etc.
<p> @GZoo I think it&#x27;s just covering their basis, in case a specific game has a very particular use of any of the DS4 characteristics in a way that is not &quot;exactly&quot; transferable to the DualSense. Like the touchpad sensitivity or something like that.They&#x27;re saying that if you play with the DS4, you&#x27;ll have the exact experience you&#x27;d have on PS4, but with possible better performance. And if you use your DualSense, there is a very remote possibility some things do not work exactly as they should, but frankly I&#x27;m pretty sure you will be completely ok using your DualSense like 99,99% of the time.
<p> I don&#x27;t understand why they felt the need to re-confirm what Sony has already confirmed. It doesn&#x27;t really inspire the prospective PS5 owners with confidence in the advertised backward compatibility feature.
<p> Should other developers follow suit and confirm their titles will run well on PS5? I don&#x27;t know, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.
<p> @darkswabber Yep, hopefully crossing my fingers about a few other ps2 classics on ps4 will be okay too-GTA Vice City &amp; GTA SA (Despite their reduced number of soundtracks,compared to the ps2 versions),Metal Slug compilation,Destroy All Humans 1 &amp; 2, Resident Evil Code Veronica X...still a crying shame how under utilized it was! Apart from the other GTA&#x27;s like VCS/LCS, there&#x27;s Need For Speed Underground 1 &amp; 2, SSX Tricky,Maximo 1 &amp; 2, Capcom Classics series &amp; soo many others that could&#x27;ve made the transition if they had!
<p> @Veturius why not? No harm in it, and if people missed these games on PS4 because they had another console/didnt have a ps4, it gives those people full confidence that they can pick up Naughty Dog&#x27;s full back catalogue in the knowledge the games will work.
<p> @Veturius people been asking for sony to confirm yet sony saying 99.9% of the 4000plus games work on ps5 doesn&#x27;t register for those who want individual games confirmed so they can complain about something if its not individual Games lol üòÜ for me I get it 4000 plus games work on ps5 is confirmation my library will work roll on Nov 19th for ps5
<p> Looks like PS4 Games played on the Next Generation Hardware will give you 60fps..............I am not sold.
Upsets me to say this but I feel the pull of Microsoft....... Sony has exclusives but to be totally honest that for me makes no difference ¬£250 to play Football Manager 2021 Touch no brainer.
<p> I would say that I&#x27;m surprised that even this news people can still twist it into something negative. But I should expect nothing less in this day and age. Lighten up people, there is already enough negativity in the world!
<p> @darkswabber Yeah,wishful thinking knowing a certain CEO&#x27;s opinion about it,but totally agree! Would love to see Ultimate Ghosts&#x27;n&#x27;Goblins along with the other G&#x27;n&#x27;G series/Maximo&#x27;s get a Mega Man type compilation from Capcom! Brick hard,but loved those games! (And the early Suikoden series from Konami too).
<p> @Robocod true. Glad I have a ps2 with an OSSC so I have my HD crisp looking ps2 fix. But with how pricey some of the best games have become especially during the pandemic, especially especially horror games, having more ps2 ports on ps5 wouldn‚Äôt be a bad thing.
<p> A little surprised that the Jak games are making it over, but this is otherwise expected. Naughty Dog is one of Sony&#x27;s star attractions, there&#x27;s absolutely no way they wouldn&#x27;t ensure those games make it over.
<p> @Veturius My guess ia that Sony didn&#x27;t have the time to thoroughly test all the games, and may have left it to publisher / players to test &amp; discover any unexpected behaviour during actual play (hence the warning to test the games before purchasing their DLC)
<p> ND is probably confirming that their games were tested and work with no issues on PS5.
<p> @2cents I believe it&#x27;s simply the attitude of, you don&#x27;t have to pay for anything you&#x27;re not happy to pay for. So if they charge, you don&#x27;t like that, don&#x27;t pay it. That&#x27;s their opinion on it I believe. Well, going from the patterns that are seen already.
<p> @Old-Red Given how many seem to hate the idea of Last of Us 2 existing, coupled with how many seem to hate paying for anything extra to be done on a game, then I&#x27;d say they made the right decision to leave news on that front.
<p> Though I&#x27;m with you, I&#x27;d like to see all of their back catalogue spruced up again in fact haha.
<p> @Rhaoulos that&#x27;s dumb af to say. The first party dev did NOT have to say that. Sony has previously stated that 99% of games will work and then also put the list of games that won&#x27;t work yesterday. They have 100% communicated this clearly
<p> Morning!!! Somewhat always knew that, Sony‚Äôs 1st party studios (Santa Monica, Naughty Dog) was gonna make their ps4 title work on ps5...the Witcher 3 will get its nextgen patch, and I hope someday Ubisoft will make the Ezio collection with a 60hz FPS and an original Assassin Creed remaster/remake ü§ûüèªü§ûüèªü§ûüèª
