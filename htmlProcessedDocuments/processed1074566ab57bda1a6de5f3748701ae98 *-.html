<p> Sony’s unifying all of its accounts, meaning that you’ll only need a PlayStation Network login moving forwards. The long overdue change will see PlayStation services such as PlayStation Store and PlayStation Now fused with Sony Mobile, Sony Electronics, and Sony Rewards. All you need to do is login to any of the company’s services with your existing PSN information and accept terms and conditions to create an account.
<p> If, for example, you already have a Sony Rewards account that’s linked to the PlayStation Network with a different email address, you’ll simply need to follow the steps and login again with your PSN credentials. This will then become your primary means to access the website moving forwards. You can find out more information through here.
<p> This feels like it’s part of a wider infrastructural overhaul from the Japanese giant, which will culminate in the introduction of a new browser-based PlayStation Store later this month, as we reported this week. Sony’s looking to streamline the experience for its members, and this seems like a solid step in the right direction – assuming it can pull off the transition without any hiccups, of course.
<p> I thought the news was going to read like having one account that can access all PS Store fronts, from UK to US to Japan so people don&#x27;t have to create separate accounts just to try some goddamn demo or some sweet deals.
<p> @lacerz Yeah, see, £10/$10 back on every £100/$100 I spend isn&#x27;t enough for me, especially on a credit card where they use your purchase data to then sell to companies wanting certain analytical data. Like Capital One UK did a while back and store cards etc. My local pizza shop can give me £10 spending £100, so I expect more from a billion or million dollar company to even make it worth my while.
<p> I understand many others are happy with any savings at all, but I simply don&#x27;t even register savings unless it&#x27;s generous haha. I&#x27;ve probably lost out on a lot in some ways, but then I would too have to have spent a lot to get the offers in the first place.
<p> @The_Great_WmR That&#x27;s my thought, it even forwards you to the Sony base website for some changes of PSN. So I&#x27;m wondering if this has been the case for a while, and they&#x27;ve only just gotten around to announcing it. Haha.
<p> @God_of_Nowt funnily enough - Microsoft has an incredible rewards program. I don’t know the maths but you would get a lot back from spending £1000. You also get points from achievements now. And when you redeem the points for credit and spend the credit, you get points for spending it too! Kind of crazy actually.
<p> I just redeemed £45 and thats not from spending anywhere near £1000 - but I do get a lot of achievements and play gamepass so it all adds up.
<p> @K1LLEGAL Haha, now that is surprising. Mind you, they&#x27;ve done a lot over the years to improve their public image since I was there.
<p> I&#x27;ve not spent £100 with Microsoft in my life, nevermind £1000. So sadly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be taking advantage of those offers.
<p> I&#x27;ve got a page up on some information for it though, and to be fair, they seem to be really pushing things in the right direction with what they&#x27;re offering. They&#x27;ve impressed me a lot recently with what they&#x27;ve done publically to brush up their offerings.
