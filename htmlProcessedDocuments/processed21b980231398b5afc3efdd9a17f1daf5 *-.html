<p> President Donald Trump’s mental fitness to hold office was the focus of a new op-ed published in the The Sydney Morning Herald by two mental health professionals.
<p> The column was written by Ian Hughes, a senior research fellow at the MaREI Centre at University College Cork in Ireland and Alan D. Blotcky, a clinical psychologist in private practice in Birmingham, Alabama.

<p> “For almost four years, there has hardly been a day that Donald Trump has not made front-page news,” they wrote. “Of all the thousands of headlines, there is one headline that has not been printed but that makes the most sense of all: ‘Donald Trump suffers from a dangerous incurable narcissistic disorder which makes him incapable of empathy or reason. He is a grave danger to the US and the world.&#x27;”
<p> “The failure of the media to [emphasize] this obvious fact is a lost opportunity to inform and educate the public so that Trump’s pathology is fully appreciated and understood. As mental health professionals know, Trump’s mental disorder manifests itself in a wide variety of [behaviors] and not in isolated or disconnected events. In these dangerous times, the challenge for the media, difficult though it is, should be to explain Trump’s pathology in all its complexities and ramifications for the public,” they explained.
<p> “Donald Trump’s narcissistic pathology did not allow him to engage in reasonable and rational debate with Joe Biden. He is incapable of rational, orderly, and thoughtful discourse, and is compelled and guided instead by his internal needs, wants, and desires. In addition, Trump is increasingly desperate because he knows his poll numbers are dropping. As a narcissist, his reflexive response when his grandiose self-image is threatened is to attack and to bully. Over the past few months, Trump’s pathological response to the threat of failure has been in plain view: wild accusations, lies, scapegoating, conspiracy theories, and gaslighting. His unpresidential debate performance was an extension of this pathological [behavior],” they wrote.
<p> The writers explained Trump in a historical context.
<p> “Donald Trump is part of a much larger picture. Individuals with dangerous personalities have risen to the highest ranks of power throughout modern history – from Nixon to Mao, Stalin to Pol Pot. Some have played a crucial role in steering our world towards disaster. A widespread understanding of this basic fact has now become essential for the protection of democracy,” they explained.

<h> ‘Each doctor wanted to touch a different part of my body’: Trump recalls COVID-19 struggle
<p> In a bizarre moment during his Michigan rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump told tales of his COVID-19 survival, and the doctors who he once claimed were terrific.
<p> Appearing before a crowded group, Trump recalled, &quot;I&#x27;m lying in bed, not feeling too great. And I&#x27;m looking up, and I see doctors out -- I just -- please will you just leave me alone. And each one of them wanted to touch a different part of my body. And I didn&#x27;t like that. I said, get the hell outa here, doctors!&quot;
<p> Trump confessed this week that his lungs were &quot;a little bit different,&quot; after having the coronavirus. His doctors have refused to release any information about the impact of the virus on Trump or his coronavirus testing timeline.
<h> Trump lies about reports of a ‘red wave’ — then touts nonexistent Michigan ‘man of the year’ award
<p> President Donald Trump ticked off several lies in just under 60 seconds while visiting his supporters in Michigan on Saturday.
<p> He told his supporters that the press was predicting an astounding &quot;red wave&quot; in November, a fact that even Fox News disputes, with their polls showing Biden leading nationally in the polls. Attacking them as &quot;the fake news media,&quot; Trump said even they were predicting a &quot;red wave&quot; saying that he was very far ahead in the early vote count.
<p> &quot;So, it just came out. We&#x27;re leading. What&#x27;s that?&quot; he asked as the crowd cheered. &quot;But let&#x27;s not talk about it.&quot;
<h> Trump laughs as Michigan rally chants ‘lock her up’ to governor the right-wing tried to kidnap and kill
<p> It&#x27;s been less than a month since the FBI thwarted a plot to kidnap and possibly kill Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), but President Donald Trump is still making fun of her.
<p> At his Saturday rally, he mocked her support of people wearing masks to help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The crowd began chanting, &quot;lock her up,&quot; a theme they often used when Trump brought up former Sec. Hillary Clinton.
<p> &quot;Lock her up, heh,&quot; Trump chuckled, allowing the chant to continue.
<p> It wasn&#x27;t just Whitmer who was at risk for an assassination attempt. The militia members also hoped to blow up the Michigan capitol, which would have killed hundreds of legislators, staffers, and workers from both sides of the aisle.
