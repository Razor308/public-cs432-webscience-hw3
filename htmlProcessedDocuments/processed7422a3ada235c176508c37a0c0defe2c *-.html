<p> He was the younger of 4 boys born to a corn merchant. His older brother Walther Heymann who died young wrote expressionistic poems for the magazine Der Sturm published by Herwalth Walden. Werner was a child prodigy, starting to sit at the piano at age 3, receiving violin lessons at age 5, and writing his own compositions at age 8.
<p> He became a member of the Philharmonic at age 12 and presented his first work for orchestra at age 16. His Spring Nocturne For Orchestra was based on one of his brother&#x27;s texts. Although he had served in the Prussian Army during World War I,[2] he later became involved with the postwar radical politics and pacifism of the Berlin scene. Moving to composing for the stage, he wrote the music for the Ernst Toller play Transformation.
<p> When sound came in, the songs he wrote for the then popular musicals became hits and are the work for which he is most well known today.
Among these films is The Congress Dances, directed by Erik Charell with whom he would work again soon on Caravan in Hollywood, after he left his country early, along with other artists, when the National Socialists took power in 1933.
<p> The emigre German director Ernst Lubitsch got him to work on 5 of his classic American comedies. He also scored 2 films by another great comedy director, Preston Sturges. Heymann was an Academy Award nominee four times in the early 1940s.[3]
<p> His memoirs, recorded on tape during his last years, were published as an autobiography in Germany in 2001. He had once summed up his thoughts thus: &quot;I love my wife, my child, the world, eating, drinking, smoking, driving. I love freedom. I hate dictatorship, godlessness, writing scores, wool next to my skin, and stones in my shoes. I hope for a United States of Europe.&quot; [5] A documentary film about his career, So Wie Ein Wunder, featuring his daughter Elisabeth Trautwein, and directed by New German Cinema auteur Helma Sanders-Brahms, was shown on German television in 2012.
