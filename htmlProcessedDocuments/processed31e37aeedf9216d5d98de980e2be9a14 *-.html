<h> Silent Hill Shattered Memories “Follow-Up” is Currently Being Pitched [Update]
<h> Could there be a sequel to Silent Hill Shattered Memories in the future?
<p> Update: Sam Barlow has clarified through DualShockers’ tweet that the pitch is not for Konami. He states that “The impetus comes from (a) people asking me for it &amp; (b) the market has hit a point where these kinds of games actually make sense, looking at what Remedy did with Control &amp; Kojima with Death Stranding, the emergence of the Triple-I game”
<p> To clarify: this isn’t for Konami. The impetus comes from (a) people asking me for it* 🙂 &amp; (b) the market has hit a point where these kinds of games actually make sense, looking at what Remedy did with Control &amp; Kojima with Death Stranding, the emergence of the Triple-I game https://t.co/lT6Gefavdd
<p> The original reporting continues below, and I’m incredibly excited to see what Barlow has up his sleeve.
<p> Original Story: Silent Hill rumors have been floating around a fair bit this year, leaving fans of the series gagging for another installment from Konami. While it might not be solid yet, it does seem as if there are plans in the works as the creator of Silent Hill Shattered Memories has confirmed he’s pitching a follow-up.
<p> Sam Barlow, the writer and designer behind Silent Hill Shattered Memories has revealed that he’s currently pitching a follow-up to that game after apparently having been asked the question in an interview. The fact he’s pitching it obviously means that he can’t share any information about it but can at least tease it.
<p> NB: this is *not* @halfmermaid Project A███████ (also spooky and awesome) it’s the next next game. Forcing your entire network of friends and acquaintances to wishlist P█ is a (free!) downpayment on the SHSM successor, also known as Project Door Peek™
<p> He also notes that what he’s pitching is not his Project A game that’s being developed by his studio, Half Mermaid Productions, but instead, it’s to be the game after that game. He pens the title he’s pitching as a successor, but it’s unclear if he’s pitching the idea to Konami, or whether he has plans to make something with his own studio.
<p> Things are certainly brewing. Personally, I think Konami has something of their own in the works, and Barlow is pitching his own thing in the same universe, or similar. I guess we’ll find out when more information comes to light.
