<p> Child: Hey tomorrow are we still go-Me: Canceled.Child: What about-Me: Postponed.Child: Well can we-Me: It’s closed to the public for the rest of the month.Child:Me:Child: This is gonna be a loooong couple of weeks for you.
<p> Don’t underestimate a child&#x27;s ability to grasp what&#x27;s happening right now. I&#x27;ve discussed the pandemic and social distancing with my 4-year-old and she&#x27;s decided to speak 3 inches from my face instead of the normal 1 inch.
<p> You know, I can handle a quarantine. I can handle rationing food. I can even handle having to relearn elementary math. But did this really have to be the week that my 4 year old learned to tell knock knock jokes?
