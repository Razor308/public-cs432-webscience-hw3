<h> One dedicated Guilty Gear Xrd fan created an ingenious rhythm game style interface to help players with the timing of combo chains.
<p> Many fighting game fans will tell you how much they often struggle with button combos, since at times the combo strings can be ridiculously complex and even harder to time properly. However, one Guilty Gear Xrd fan by the name of Starsky has opened our eyes to how these combos can be displayed to be far more intuitive. Check out the video below:

<p> During the stage event dedicated to Guilty Gear at Tokyo Game Show 2019, Daisuke Ishiwatari and Akira Katano explained how they particularly detailed the characters’ facial animations and how it’s basically “3D Sakuga.” You can really see that with the tons of different expressions the characters emote during their attacks and supers. At that same event, they also mentioned that the stage change mechanic has actual gameplay mechanics embedded into it. We’ve translated the full event here if you want to read more.
<p> Guilty Gear -STRIVE- was first teased during EVO 2019. Daisuke Ishiwatari, the General Director, stated how the new Guilty Gear game isn’t an “evolution” of the series, nor a return to its roots,” but instead a “complete rebuild of the franchise.” Instead of adding or removing elements compared to the previous games, he described the development as completely breaking it down, picking up everything that made the series charming and unique, and rebuilding it with those components.
<p> Ishiwatari then mentioned that this new Guilty Gear game is a “big challenge which will go head to head against the essence of fighting games.” He added that going this route is a risky bet, but they’re confident they can pull it off and bring out new possibilities, using all the experience and materials they’ve accumulated so far. He ended the message saying he believes games are bridges which can connect people, so he hopes this new Guilty Gear will reflect this idea.
