<p> Nurse Cristina Hops posted a video to TikTok reacting to Donald Trump coronavirus tweet in which he wrote &quot;don&#x27;t be afraid of Covid. Don&#x27;t let it dominate your life.&quot;
<p> (CNN)One nurse has a message for President Donald Trump: The coronavirus pandemic is still something people should care about.
<p> Cristina Hops, who works on the frontlines helping patients fighting coronavirus, said she was upset after reading the President&#x27;s tweet on Monday, in which he told Americans &quot;don&#x27;t be afraid of Covid. Don&#x27;t let it dominate your life.&quot;
<p> &quot;When I read that and I got home, I was just so angry about it that I felt like I needed to say something,&quot; Hops, who is based in Seattle, Washington, told CNN.
<p> So, she made a TikTok video, to share her emotions with the world. &quot;I have seen hundreds of people suffocating to death and for him to say do not be afraid of Covid is astounding, &quot;she says in the video, while tearing up.&quot;How dare he undermine all of the work that we have done as nurses and health care providers?&quot;
<p> Her message resonated -- and the video quickly garnered more than 300,000 views on TikTok, as of Thursday evening. It&#x27;s been shared across social media platforms, with people lauding the nurse for speaking her mind.

<p> In her experience as a health care worker, Hops said she has seen how a surge in coronavirus cases can drastically impact a community. She was sent to Miami, Florida, over the summerfor five weeks to help a hospital with its influx of cases.
<p> &quot;The hospital that I was working at was completely overrun,&quot; she told CNN. &quot;It&#x27;s not possible to give everybody the care that they need and deserve when the hospital is that full.&quot;
<p> While Hops doesn&#x27;t believe people should live in fear, she said she felt the President&#x27;s words were irresponsible and disrespectful given how many people have been personally affected by the virus. More than 7.6 million people -- including the President -- have contracted coronavirus in the US, and over 212,000 people have died from the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
<p> &quot;People are going to take this (Trump&#x27;s words) as everything is okay and it&#x27;s not a problem anymore and that&#x27;s just not the case,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#x27;s just not true.&quot;
<p> Hops said she hopes that those who see her video understand the importance of taking precautions when it comes to the virus.
<p> If the President were to see her video, she said she wants him to realize his experience with the virus does not reflect the experience of every American.
<p> &quot;What&#x27;s most important is that we&#x27;re taking care of each other and we&#x27;re looking out for each other,&quot; she said. &quot;And I don&#x27;t feel like his tweet or any of his tweets reflect that.&quot;
