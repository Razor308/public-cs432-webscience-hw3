<p> GungHo Online Entertainment has released another Dev Diary video for Ninjala, sharing the first details of the game&#x27;s upcoming third season.
<p> Season 3 arrives on 28th October, running right through until 7th January. It&#x27;ll add new weapons, a new stage, and plenty more besides, all of which is detailed below.
<p> The Croissant Arena is a French-inspired stage that features the new Drone Monitor, which allows players to locate where Drones will spawn.
<p> Two new Hammer weapons will be introduced alongside a new Gum Ninjitsu, Special and Gum Shoot.
<p> The Baiting Shark Ninjutsu is a trap where players place an unassuming scroll on the ground and, when another player comes near, a shark will jump out and attack them.
<p> The Full-Throttle Field Special allows players to deploy a health regenerating barrier to help protect and heal a wounded Ninja.
<p> The Gum Laser Gum Shoot fires a laser in a straight line and will burn anything between you and the end of the beam.
<p> Story Mode Chapter 2 will follow Berecca and her quest to uncover the truth behind her father’s death. Players who complete the latest story mode chapter will earn special items for their Avatar, and additional items can be unlocked by players who achieve a Gold Rank on each section of the story.
<p> The Kyary Pamyu Pamyu - Ninja Re Bang Bang Steve Aoki Remix collab will run from October 28 until November 25, and players will be able to purchase the BGM remix to play during battle, Kyary’s ninja outfit from her original music video, and a themed dance emote from the Specialty Shop.
<p> Cartoon Anime episode 4 will feature Kappei and introduce the mascot character Gumchi to the world of Ninjala.
<p> Spectator Mode will allow players to watch matches in Battle Royale and Team Battle modes from an overhead camera or switch between different player POVs.
<p> The team also promises new quality of life updates that will be added to the game soon, as well as improvements to the matchmaking system which will aim to be &quot;much more balanced when assigning opponents as well as speeding it up to let players jump into the action even quicker.&quot;
<p> Ryan can list the first 151 Pokémon all in order off by heart – a feat he calls his ‘party trick’ despite being such an introvert that he’d never be found anywhere near a party. He’d much rather just have a night in with Mario Kart and a pizza, and we can’t say we blame him.
<p> Can’t wait for not to be able to find this in the Dutch eshop... it’s weird it’s not available here, regulations here are no different as we get most gacha style games here. It seems like they think we must be Belgium or something.
<p> @ferryb001 you can actually temporarily change your nintendo account region so you don&#x27;t need to make a new one. Once you download the game from the NA eshop, for example, I think you can switch it back to your native region and play it!
<p> thank god weapon skins are permanent now, at least for people who pay for the pass. i think only people who spend real money on the game would care about them anyway. pumped to hear about chap 2 in story mode finally too
<p> along with the new stage, weapons, and cartoon, this is looking to be a better season already
<p> Nah. You&#x27;ve had your one chance with me and you absolutely ruined it. Your netcode is absolutely abysmal, you wrongfully ban idle players, and you have abysmal matchmaking that&#x27;s somehow worse than Splatoon 2&#x27;s. You&#x27;ll soon be forgotten and mocked and laughed at soon enough, GungHo Games/Ninjala. It&#x27;s just a matter of time...
<p> Awesome, I was wondering when Season 3 would be announced. I think the new stage and weapons look cool. I&#x27;m also interested in the new chapter of the story. This seems to be a more substantial season than the last 2 seasons.
<p> @OctoAori20If you&#x27;re talking about the first beta&#x27;s matchmaking and netcode, then yeah it was bad, but I haven&#x27;t had many issues since launch and each update has made it slightly better than the update before it.
<p> @NinjalaislitSorry, Im a little bit desconnected when we talk about Ninjala... I didn’t knew they are releasing a new map.Anyways, i feel the game kinda repetitive, but since you said they’re making more maps, I might try the game again!
